    <h2>NUMISMATIC ARCHÆOLOGY.</h2>

    <p>A magnificent work<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       upon this subject has just been completed in Paris, where it
       was commenced fifteen years ago. It was begun under the
       auspices of M. Paul Delaroche and M.C. Lenormand, member of
       the Institute, and well known already as one of the first
       authorities in the numismatic branch of archæology. Some
       faint idea of the greatness of the task may be given by
       stating that it embraces the whole range of art, from the
       regal coins of Syracuse and of the Ptolemies, down to those
       of our day; that such a stupendous scheme should ever have
       been carried into execution is not solely due to the
       admirable ease and fidelity, with which the "Collas machine"
       renders the smallest and the largest gems of the antique:
       but to him who first felt, appreciated, and afterward
       promoted its capabilities in this labor of love, M.A.
       Lachevardiere. Comparisons and contrasts, which are the life
       of art, though generally confined to the mental vision, are
       not the least of the recommendations of this vast work. For
       the first time have the minor treasures of each country been
       brought together, and not the least conspicuous portion are
       those from the British Museum and the Bank of England.</p>

    <p>Whether we consider the selection of these monumental
    relics, the explanatory letterpress, or the engravings which
    reproduce them, we are struck by the admirable taste, science,
    and fidelity with which the largest as well as the smallest
    gems have each and every one been made to tally in size with
    the originals.</p>

    <p>The collection of the "Trésor de Numismatique et Glyptique,"
    consisting of twenty volumes in folio, and containing a
    thousand engraved plates in folio, reproduces upward of 15,000
    specimens, and is divided into three classes&mdash;1st. The
    coins, medals, cameos, &amp;c. of antiquity; 2d. Those of the
    middle ages; lastly, those of modern times. The details of this
    immense mass of artistic wealth would be endless; but these
    three classes seem to be arranged according to the latest
    classification of numismatists.</p>

    <p>In the first class may be noticed&mdash;1. The regal coins
    of Greece, which contains, beside the portraits of the Greek
    Kings, to be found in Visconti's "Iconographie," copied from
    medals and engraved gems, all the coins bearing the Greek name
    of either a king, a prince, or a tyrant, and every variety of
    these types, whether they bear the effigy of a prince, or only
    reproduce his name. To the medals of each sovereign are joined
    the most authentic and celebrated engraved gems of European
    cabinets. Next come the series of portraits of the Roman
    emperors and their families, with all the important varieties
    of Roman numismatics, amongst which will be found the most
    celebrated coins of France, Vienna, Dresden, Munich, Florence,
    Naples, St. Petersburg, Weimar, &amp;c.; and, moreover, those
    medallions which perpetuate great events. These two volumes
    contain eight-fold more matter than the great work of
    Visconti.</p>

    <p>In the second class, containing the works of the middle
    ages, and showing the uninterrupted progress of the numismatic
    art down to modern times, and forming alone fourteen volumes,
    we find the source which the French artists and men of letters
    have studied with such predilection. First in order are the
    Italian medals of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,
    chiefly by the famous Victor Pisano, a Veronese, whom Nasari
    has so much lauded. The scholars and imitators of Pisano also
    produced works as interesting as historical documents as they
    are admirable in workmanship. Here also will be found the
    French and English seals, in which the balance of skill in
    design and execution is acknowledged to be in our favor.</p>

    <p>Less barbarous, and indeed perfect works of art, in
    character of costume and visage, are the medals struck in
    Germany during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when
    the influence of Albert Durer and his school was strongly felt.
    And finally, relics of ornamental art of different nations and
    epochs.</p>

    <p>In the third class, two parts only are devoted to
    contemporary art; the medals illustrative of the French
    revolution of 1789; those of the "Empire" and of the Emperor
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"
       id="page258"></a>[pg 258]</span> "Napoleon;" generally
       smacking of the florid and corrupt taste of that period,
       they are nevertheless curious as being often the sole
       evidence of the facts commemorated. There is, however, a
       manifest improvement in the late ones, and in them may be
       traced the transition from the independent ideas of the
       revolution to the subsequent submission to one man: and not
       less striking is the transition from a slip-shod style of
       art to a pedantic imitation of the antique. The "Trésor de
       Numismatique et de Glyptique" is the most scientific and
       important work of art which has been executed and achieved
       of late years in France. Our great public libraries may be
       proud of possessing so rich, so valuable, and so curious a
       collection,</p>

    <p>Most lovers of art have their favorite periods and
    well-beloved masters, but in this varied range of excellence it
    is difficult which to select for preference and admiration. The
    cameos have a beauty and <i>finesse</i> which far surpass that
    of busts and statues; they evince the skill of grouping, which,
    with rare exceptions, such as the Niobe and Laocoon, is seldom
    aimed at in the more important pieces of sculpture. Cameos,
    moreover, let us, as it were, into the secrets of indoor life.
    To these considerations we may add that these gems have had an
    immense influence on French modern art. The "Apotheosis of
    Augustus" especially, known to antiquarians as the "Agate of
    Tiberius," the largest cameo in the world, and beautifully
    engraved the size of the original in this collection, may be
    traced in more than one of their late compositions.</p>

    <p>It is said that large medallions are a sign of taste either
    in the medalist or the monarch he is supposed to honor; if so,
    Dupré and Varin have drawn a thick vail over the effulgence of
    Louis XIV. We would not, however, lose their wigs and smiles
    for a world of historiettes.</p>

    <p>But it is to be remembered that the more names are blazoned
    on works of art, the more art becomes deteriorated. In this
    respect the present collection shows the rapidly progressive
    march of this evil through twenty-five centuries&mdash;a most
    instructive subject of contemplation.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>THE CSIKOS OF HUNGARY.</h2>

    <p>Of the chivalry, the gallantry, the splendor, the
    hospitality, the courage, and the love of liberty of the
    Hungarian noble or gentleman, no one doubts. Of his ideas of
    true constitutional freedom, or the zeal with which that or
    Hungarian independence has been maintained first through
    Turkish, and then German domination for some hundred years
    past, doubts may be entertained. Neither do the Hungarian
    peasantry or people reflect high credit on their "natural
    superiors." Something should be deducted for the forced
    vivacity and straining after effect of the littérateur; but
    this sketch of a large class of peasantry from Max
    Schlesinger's "War in Hungary," just published in London, must
    have some foundation in truth&mdash;and very like the Red
    Indians or half-breeds of Spanish America the people look.</p>

    <p>"The Csikos is a man who from his birth, somehow or other,
    finds himself seated upon a foal. Instinctively the boy remains
    fixed upon the animal's back, and grows up in his seat as other
    children do in the cradle.</p>

    <p>"The boy grows by degrees to a big horse-herd. To earn his
    livelihood, he enters the service of some nobleman, or of the
    Government, who possess in Hungary immense herds of wild
    horses. These herds range over a tract of many German square
    miles, for the most part some level plain, with wood, marsh,
    heath, and moorland; they rove about where they please,
    multiply, and enjoy freedom of existence. Nevertheless, it is a
    common error to imagine that these horses, like a pack of
    wolves in the mountains, are left to themselves and nature,
    without any care or thought of man. Wild horses, in the proper
    sense of the term, are in Europe at the present day only met
    with in Bessarabia; whereas the so-called wild herds in Hungary
    may rather be compared to the animals ranging in our large
    parks, which are attended to and watched. The deer are left to
    the illusion that they enjoy the most unbounded freedom; and
    the deer-stalker, when in pursuit of his game, readily gives in
    to the same illusion. Or, to take another simile, the reader
    has only to picture to himself a well-constituted free state,
    whether a republic or a monarchy is all one.</p>

    <p>"The Csikos has the difficult task of keeping a watchful eye
    upon these herds. He knows their strength, their habits, the
    spots they frequent; he knows the birthday of every foal, and
    when the animal, fit for training, should be taken out of the
    herd. He has then a hard task upon his hands, compared with
    which a Grand-Ducal wild-boar hunt is child's play; for the
    horse has not only to be taken alive from the midst of the
    herd, but of course safe and sound in wind and limb. For this
    purpose, the celebrated whip of the Csikos serves him; probably
    at some future time a few splendid specimens of this instrument
    will be exhibited in the Imperial Arsenal at Vienna, beside the
    sword of Scanderberg and the Swiss 'morning-stars.'</p>

    <p>"This whip has a stout handle from one and a half to two
    feet long, and a cord which measures not less than from
    eighteen to twenty-four feet in length. The cord is attached to
    a short iron chain, fixed to the top of the handle by an iron
    ring. A large leaden button is fastened to the end of the cord,
    and similar smaller buttons are distributed along it at
    distances, according to certain rules derived from experience,
    of which we are ignorant. Armed with this weapon, which the
    Csikos carries in his belt, together with a short
    grappling-iron or hook, he sets out on his horse-chase. Thus
    mounted and equipped without saddle or stirrup, he flies like
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page259"
       id="page259"></a>[pg 259]</span> the storm-wind over the
       heath, with such velocity that the grass scarcely bends
       under the horse's hoof; the step of his horse is not heard,
       and the whirling cloud of dust above his head alone marks
       his approach and disappearance. Although familiar with the
       use of a bridle, he despises such a troublesome article of
       luxury, and guides his horse with his voice, hands, and
       feet&mdash;nay, it almost seems as if he directed it by the
       mere exercise of the will, as we move our feet to the right
       or left, backward or forward, without its ever coming into
       our head to regulate our movements by a leather strap.</p>

    <p>"In this manner for hours he chases the flying herd, until
    at length he succeeds in approaching the animal which he is
    bent on catching. He then swings his whip round in immense
    circles, and throws the cord with such dexterity and precision
    that it twines around the neck of his victim. The leaden button
    at the end, and the knots along the cord, form a noose, which
    draws closer and tighter the faster the horse hastens on.</p>

    <p>"See how he flies along with outstretched legs, his mane
    whistling in the wind, his eye darting fire, his mouth covered
    with foam, and the dust whirling aloft on all sides! But the
    noble animal breathes shorter, his eye grows wild and staring,
    his nostrils are reddened with blood, the veins of his neck are
    distended like cords, his legs refuse longer service&mdash;he
    sinks exhausted and powerless, a picture of death. But at the
    same instant the pursuing steed likewise stands still and fixed
    as if turned to stone. An instant, and the Csikos has flung
    himself off his horse upon the ground, and inclining his body
    backward, to keep the noose tight, he seizes the cord
    alternately with the right and left hand, shorter and shorter,
    drawing himself by it nearer and nearer to the panting and
    prostrate animal, till at last coming up to it he flings his
    legs across its back. He now begins to slacken the noose
    gently, allowing the creature to recover breath: but hardly
    does the horse feel this relief, before he leaps up, and darts
    off again in a wild course, as if still able to escape from his
    enemy. But the man is already bone of his bone and flesh of his
    flesh; he sits fixed upon his neck as if grown to it, and makes
    the horse feel his power at will, by tightening or slackening
    the cord. A second time the hunted animal sinks upon the
    ground; again he rises, and again breaks down, until at length,
    overpowered with exhaustion, he can no longer stir a
    limb....</p>

    <p>"The foot-soldier who has discharged his musket is lost when
    opposed to the Csikos. His bayonet, with which he can defend
    himself against the Uhlans and Hussars, is here of no use to
    him; all his practiced maneuvers and skill are unavailing
    against the long whip of his enemy, which drags him to the
    ground, or beats him to death with his leaden buttons; nay,
    even if he had still a charge in his musket, he could sooner
    hit a bird on the wing than the Csikos, who, riding round and
    round him in wild bounds, dashes with his steed first to one
    side then to another, with the speed of lightning, so as to
    frustrate any aim. The horse-soldier, armed in the usual
    manner, fares not much better; and wo to him if he meets a
    Csikos singly! better to fall in with a pack of ravenous
    wolves."</p>

    <h2>THE PRESENT RELIGION OF PERSIA.</h2>

    <p>An account of the Expedition for the survey of the rivers
    Euphrates and Tigris, carried on by order of the British
    Government, in the years 1835, 1836, and 1837; preceded by
    geographical and historical notices of the regions situated
    between the Nile and the Indus, with fourteen maps and charts,
    and ninety-seven plates, besides numerous woodcuts, has just
    appeared in London, in four large volumes, from the pen of
    Lieutenant-Colonel Chesney, R.A., F.R.S., &amp;c., commander of
    the Expedition. It is too comprehensive a work ever to be
    reprinted here, or to be much read, even in England, but it is
    undoubtedly very valuable as an authority. The following
    paragraphs from it describe the present state of religion in
    Persia:</p>

    <p>"The title of Múlla is conferred on a candidate by some
    member of the order, after the requisite examination in
    theology and law; and the person is then intrusted with the
    education of youth, as well as the administration of justice,
    and the practice of law. The Múllas sometimes possess
    sufficient power not only to influence the people at large, but
    even the King himself.</p>

    <p>"Of this class of priests, those who have been successful in
    life are either placed in mosques or private families, waiting
    for advancement; but a greater number are nominally attached to
    colleges, and live by the practice of astrology,
    fortune-telling, the sale of charms, talismans, &amp;c. They
    who are not possessed of the requisite ingenuity to subsist by
    the credulity of others, take charge of an inferior school, or
    write letters, and draw up marriage and other engagements, for
    those who are unequal to the task. They mix at the same time
    largely in the domestic concerns of families. But in addition
    to these and other vocations, a considerable number of the
    lowest priests derive a scanty support from that charity which
    no one denies to the true believer. These men wander as fakirs
    from place to place, carrying news, and repeating poems, tales,
    &amp;c., mixed with verses from the Koran. The heterodox
    religions are very numerous; nor is Irián without her
    free-thinkers, as the Kamúrs and Mu'tazelís, (Mitaulis,) who
    deny everything which they cannot prove by natural reason. A
    third sect, the Mahadelis, or Molochadis, still maintain the
    Magian belief that the stars and the planets govern all things.
    Another, the Ehl el Tabkwid, (men of truth,) hold that there is
    no God except the four elements, and no rational soul or life
    after this one. They maintain also, that all living bodies,
    being mixtures of the elements, will
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page260"
       id="page260"></a>[pg 260]</span> after death return to their
       first principles. They also affirm that paradise and hell
       belong to this world, into which every man returns in the
       form of a beast, a plant, or again as a man; and that in
       this second state, he is great, powerful, and happy, or
       poor, despicable, and unhappy, according to his former
       merits or demerits. In practice they inculcate kindness to
       and respect for each other, with implicit obedience to their
       chiefs, who are called Pir, (old men,) and are furnished
       with all kinds of provisions for their subsistence. This
       sect is found in the provinces of Irák and Fárs.</p>

    <p>"The Táríkh Zenádikah (way of the covetous) are directly
    opposed to the last on the subject of transmigration; and they
    believe that God is in all places, and performs all things.
    They likewise maintain that the whole visible universe is only
    a manifestation of the Supreme Being; the soul itself being a
    portion of the Divine essence. Therefore, they consider, that
    whatever appears to the eye is God, and that all religious
    rites should be comprised in the contemplation of God's
    goodness and greatness.</p>

    <p>"On these various creeds the different branches of Suffeeism
    seem to have been founded. One of the most extraordinary of
    these sects is the Rasháníyah; the followers of which believe
    in the transmigration of souls, and the manifestation of the
    Divinity in the persons of holy men. They maintain likewise,
    that all men who do not join their sect are to be considered as
    dead, and that their goods belong, in consequence, to the true
    believers, as the only survivors."</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>THE "OLD DUKE OF QUEENSBURY."</h2>

    <p>Mr. Burke gives in his gossiping book about the English
    aristocracy, the following anecdotes of this once famous
    person:</p>

    <p>"Few men occupied a more conspicuous place about the court
    and town for nearly seventy years, during the reigns of the
    Second and Third Georges. Like Wilmot Earl of Rochester, he
    pursued pleasure under every shape, and with as much ardor at
    fourscore as he had done at twenty. At the decease of his
    father, in 1731, he became Earl of March; and he subsequently,
    in 1748, inherited his mother's earldom of Ruglen, together
    with the family's estates in the counties of Edinburgh and
    Linlithgow. These rich endowments of fortune, and a handsome
    person, of which he was especially careful, combined to invest
    the youthful Earl with no ordinary attractions, and the
    ascendency they acquired he retained for a longer period than
    any one of his contemporaries; from his first appearance in the
    fashionable world in the year 1746, to the year he left it
    forever, in 1810, at the age of eighty-five, he was always an
    object of comparative notoriety. There was no interregnum in
    the public course of his existence. His first distinction he
    achieved on the turf; his knowledge of which, both in theory
    and practice, equaled that of the most accomplished adepts of
    Newmarket. In all his principal matches he rode himself, and in
    that branch of equitation rivaled the most professional
    jockeys. Properly accoutered in his velvet cap, red silken
    jacket, buckskin breeches, and long spurs, his Lordship bore
    away the prize on many a well-contested field. His famous match
    with the Duke of Hamilton was long remembered in sporting
    annals. Both noblemen rode their own horses, and each was
    supported by numerous partisans. The contest took place on the
    race-ground at Newmarket, and attracted all the fashionables of
    the period. Lord March, thin, agile, and admirably qualified
    for exertion, was the victor. Still more celebrated was his
    Lordship's wager with the famous Count O'Taafe. During a
    conversation at a convivial meeting on the subject of 'running
    against time,' it was suggested by Lord March, that it was
    possible for a carriage to be drawn with a degree of celerity
    previously unexampled, and believed to be impossible. Being
    desired to name his maximum, he undertook, provided choice of
    ground were given him and a certain period for training, to
    draw a carriage with four wheels not less than nineteen miles
    within the space of sixty minutes. The accomplishment of such
    rapidity staggered the belief of his hearers; and a heavy wager
    was the consequence. Success mainly depending on the lightness
    of the carriage, Wright of Long Acre, the most ingenious
    coach-builder of the day, devoted the whole resources of his
    skill to its construction, and produced a vehicle formed partly
    of wood and partly of whale-bone, with silk harness, that came
    up to the wishes of his employer. Four blood horses of approved
    speed were then selected, and the course at Newmarket chosen as
    the ground of contest. On the day appointed, 29th of August,
    1750, noble and ignoble gamesters journeyed from far and near
    to witness the wonderful experiment; excitement reached the
    highest point, and bets to an enormous amount were made. At
    length the jockeys mounted; the carriage was put in motion, and
    rushing on with a velocity marvelous in those times of coach
    traveling, but easily conceived by us railway travelers of the
    nineteenth century, gained within the stipulated hour the goal
    of victory."</p>

    <h2>THE DECAY OF GREAT FAMILIES.</h2>

    <p>Not the least valuable parts of Burke's just published
    "Anecdotes of the Aristocracy," are a species of essay on the
    fortunes of families. The following is from a chapter on their
    decadence:</p>

    <p>"It has often occurred to us that a very interesting paper
    might be written on the rise and fall of English families.
    Truly does Dr. Borlase remark that 'the most lasting houses
    have only their seasons, more or less, of a certain
    constitutional strength. They have their spring and summer
    sunshine glare, their wane, decline, and death.' Take, for
    example, the Plantagenets, the Staffords, and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page261"
       id="page261"></a>[pg 261]</span> Nevills, the three most
       illustrious names on the roll of England's nobility. What
       race in Europe surpassed in royal position, in personal
       achievement, our Henries and our Edwards? and yet we find
       the great-great-grandson of Margaret Plantagenet, daughter
       and heiress of George Duke of Clarence, following the craft
       of a cobbler at the little town of Newport in Shropshire, in
       the year 1637. Beside, if we were to investigate the
       fortunes of many of the inheritors of the royal arms, it
       would soon be discovered that</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>'The aspiring blood of Lancaster'</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>had sunk into the ground. The princely stream at the present
    time flows through very humble veins. Among the lineal
    descendants of Edmund of Woodstock, Earl of Kent, sixth son of
    Edward I., King of England, entitled to quarter the Royal arms,
    occur Mr. Joseph Smart, of Hales Owen, butcher, and Mr. George
    Wilmot, keeper of the turnpike-gate at Cooper's Bank, near
    Dudley; and among the descendants of Thomas Plantagenet, Duke
    of Gloucester, fifth son of Edward III., we may mention Mr.
    Stephen James Penny, the late sexton at St. George's, Hanover
    Square.</p>

    <p>"The story of the Gargraves is a melancholy chapter in the
    romance of real life. For full two centuries, or more, scarcely
    a family in Yorkshire enjoyed a higher position. Its chiefs
    earned distinction in peace and war; one died in France, Master
    of the Ordnance to King Henry V.; another, a soldier, too, fell
    with Salisbury, at the siege of Orleans; and a third filled the
    Speaker's chair of the House of Commons. What an awful contrast
    to this fair picture does the sequel offer. Thomas Gargrave,
    the Speaker's eldest son, was hung at York, for murder; and his
    half-brother, Sir Richard, endured a fate only less miserable.
    The splendid estate he inherited he wasted by the most wanton
    extravagance, and at length reduced himself to abject want.
    'His excesses,' says Mr. Hunter, in his 'History of Doncaster,'
    'are still, at the expiration of two centuries, the subject of
    village tradition; and his attachment to gaming is commemorated
    in an old painting, long preserved in the neighboring mansion
    of Badsworth, in which he is represented as playing at the old
    game of put, the right hand against the left, for the stake of
    a cup of ale.</p>

    <p>"The close of Sir Richard's story is as lamentable as its
    course. An utter bankrupt in means and reputation, he is stated
    to have been reduced to travel with the pack-horses to London,
    and was at last found dead in an old hostelry! He had married
    Catherine, sister of Lord Danvers, and by her left three
    daughters. Of the descendants of his brothers few particulars
    can be ascertained. Not many years since, a Mr. Gargrave,
    believed to be one of them, filled the mean employment of
    parish-clerk of Kippax.</p>

    <p>"A similar melancholy narrative applies to another great
    Yorkshire house. Sir William Reresby, Bart., son and heir of
    the celebrated author, succeeded, at the death of his father,
    in 1689, to the beautiful estate of Thrybergh, in Yorkshire,
    where his ancestors had been seated uninterruptedly from the
    time of the Conquest; and he lived to see himself denuded of
    every acre of his broad lands. Le Neve states, in his MSS.
    preserved in the Heralds' College, that he became a tapster in
    the King's Bench Prison, and was tried and imprisoned for
    cheating in 1711. He was alive in 1727, when Wootton's account
    of the Baronets was published. In that work he is said to be
    reduced to a low condition. At length he died in great
    obscurity, a melancholy instance how low pursuits and base
    pleasures may sully the noblest name, and waste an estate
    gathered with labor and preserved by the care of a race of
    distinguished progenitors. Gaming was amongst Sir William's
    follies&mdash;particularly that lowest specimen of the folly,
    the fights of game-cocks. The tradition at Thrybergh is (for
    his name is not quite forgotten) that the fine estate of
    Dennaby was staked and lost on a single main. Sir William
    Reresby was not the only baronet who disgraced his order at
    that period. In 1722, Sir Charles Burton was tried at the Old
    Bailey for stealing a seal; pleaded poverty, but was found
    guilty, and sentenced to transportation; which sentence was
    afterward commuted for a milder punishment."</p>

    <h2>MADRID AND THE SPANISH SENATE.</h2>

    <p>Gazpacho; or, Summer Months in Spain, is the title of a new
    book by W. George Clark, published in London. Gazpacho, it
    seems, is the name of a dish peculiar to Spain, but of
    universal use there, a sort of cold soup, made up of familiars
    and handy things, as bread, pot-herbs, oil, and water. "My
    Gazpacho," says the author, "has been prepared after a similar
    receipt. I know not how it will please the more refined and
    fastidious palates to which it will be submitted; indeed, amid
    the multitude of dainties wherewith the table is loaded, it may
    well remain untasted." It at least deserves a better fate than
    that. The volume relates, in a pleasant, intelligent, and
    gossiping way, a summer's ramble through Spain, describing with
    considerable force the peculiarities of its people, and the
    romantic features by which it is marked. The clever painter
    could not have better materials. The party-colored costumes of
    the peasants, like dahlias at a Chiswick show; the somber
    garments of the priests, the fine old churches, the queer
    rambling houses, looking centuries old, the dull, gloomy
    streets of Madrid, the life and activity of the market-place.
    Such are the objects upon which the eye rests, and of which Mr.
    Clark was too observant to neglect any. The following passages
    will give an idea of the materials of which the Gazpacho is
    made up:&mdash;</p>

    <h4>MADRID.</h4>

    <p>"I left, I suppose, scarcely a street in Madrid which I did
    not traverse, or a church which I did not enter. The result is
    hardly worth the trouble. One street and church
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"
       id="page262"></a>[pg 262]</span> are exactly like another
       street and church. In the latter, one always finds the same
       profusion of wooden Christs, and Madonnas in real
       petticoats, on the walls, and the same scanty sprinkling of
       worshipers, also in petticoats, on the floor. The images
       outnumber the devotees here, as in all other Roman Catholic
       countries (except Ireland, which is an exception to every
       rule.) To a stranger, the markets are always the most
       interesting haunts. A Spaniard, he or she, talks more while
       making the daily bargain than in all the rest of the
       twenty-four hours. The fruit and vegetable market was my
       especial lounge. There is such a fresh, sweet smell of the
       country, and the groups throw themselves, or are thrown,
       into such pretty tableaux after the Rubens and Snyders
       fashion. The shambles one avoids instinctively, and
       fish-market there is none, for Madrid is fifty hours'
       journey from the nearest sea, and the Manzanares has every
       requisite for a fine trout stream, but water.</p>

    <p>"Madrid has one peculiarity which conduces very much to the
    visitor's comfort, namely, that there are very few inevitable
    'sights' to be gone through. The armory said to be the finest
    in the world; the palace, ditto (which people who are addicted
    to upholstering may go and see, if they don't mind breaking the
    tenth commandment); the museum of natural history, where is the
    largest loadstone in active operation between this and Medina;
    and the Academia, nearly complete the list. Everybody should
    devote a morning to the last-named, were it only for the sake
    of the Murillos. The famous picture of 'St. Isabel giving alms
    to the sick' has been arrested at Madrid on its return from
    Paris to Seville. As the Sevilians have instituted a 'process'
    for its recovery, it is likely to stay there for some time
    longer. 'The Patrician's Dream' is quite cheering to look upon,
    so rich and glowing it is. Shut your eyes to the semi-ludicrous
    effect of husband, wife, and dog, in a decreasing series, like
    the three genders in Lindley Murray, all asleep.</p>

    <p>"The gardens of the queen, sunk in a deep hollow below the
    palace, deserve a visit. The head-gardener, of course a
    Frenchman, struggles gallantly against all kinds of
    difficulties of soil, climate, and lack of water. By a series
    of ingenious artifices he has concocted a plot of grass, some
    ten feet square, to the great astonishment of all natives."</p>

    <h4>NARVAEZ IN THE SENATE.</h4>

    <p>"One day my kind friend Colonel S. took me to hear a debate
    in the <i>Senado</i>, the Spanish Chamber of Peers, which holds
    its sittings in the chapel of a suppressed convent, near the
    palace. By dint of paint, gilding, and carpets, the room has
    been divested of its sanctified aspect, and made to look like a
    handsome modern room. They have not thought it necessary that a
    place in which a hundred gentlemen in surtouts meet to discuss
    secular matters in this nineteenth century, should be made to
    resemble a chapel of the fifteenth. Antiquity is here
    represented in the person of two halberdiers, who stand to
    guard the door, dressed in extravagant costume, like beefeaters
    in full bloom. Rows of raised seats extend on each side of the
    room; in the center, facing the beef-eaters, are the chair and
    desk of the president, and on each side a little tribune, from
    which the clerks read out documents from time to time. The
    spectators are accommodated in niches round the walls. Each
    member speaks from his place, and the voting is by ballot.
    First a footman hands round a tray of beans, and then each
    advances, when his name is called, to a table in the center,
    where he drops his bean into the box. The beans are then
    counted, and the result proclaimed by the president. On the
    right of the chair, in the front, is the bench assigned to the
    ministers; and there I had the good luck to see Narvaez,
    otherwise called Duke of Valencia, and a great many fine names
    besides, and, in reality, master of all the Spains. His face
    wears a fixed expression of inflexible resolve, very effective,
    and garnished with a fierce dyed mustache, and a somewhat
    palpable wig to match. His style of dress was what, in an
    inferior man, one would have called 'dandified.' An
    unexceptionable surtout, opened to display a white waistcoat
    with sundry chains, and the extremities terminated,
    respectively, in patent leather and primrose kid. During the
    discussion he alternately fondled a neat riding-whip and aired
    a snowy pocket-handkerchief. Those who know him give him credit
    for good intentions and great courage, but do not expect that
    he will ever set the Thames on fire, whatever he may do to the
    Manzanares. He is a mixture, they say, of the chivalric and the
    asinine: a kind of moral mule. His personal weakness is a wish
    to be thought young, and hence he was naturally angry when Lord
    Palmerston wanted to give him a 'wrinkle.' I saw, likewise,
    Mon, the Minister of Finance, smiling complacently, like a
    shopkeeper on his customers; and the venerable Castanos, Duke
    of Bailen, who, as he tottered in, stooping under the weight of
    ninety years, was affectionately greeted by Narvaez and others.
    On the whole, the debate seemed to be languid, and to be
    listened to with little interest; but that is the general fate
    of debates in July."</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>THE KANASZ.</h2>

    <p>Of the Servian swineherd we have heard something of late,
    both in history and romance; because this was the vocation of
    Kara George, the Servian Liberator. In Hungary the swine-keeper
    does not seem to be so respectable a person. Here is a sketch
    of him from Max Schlesinger's new book on the Hungarian
    war:</p>

    <p>"The Kanasz is a swineherd, whose occupation, everywhere
    unpoetical and dirty, is doubly troublesome and dirty in
    Hungary. Large droves of pigs migrate annually into the latter
    country from Serbia, where they still live in a half-wild
    state. In Hungary <span class="pagenum"><a name="page263"
       id="page263"></a>[pg 263]</span> they fatten in the
       extensive oak-forests, and are sent to market in the large
       towns, even to Vienna, and still further....</p>

    <p>"It is a true enjoyment to live in these shady forests. The
    oak attains a finer and more luxuriant growth on the Hungarian
    soil than in any part of Germany. The hogs find food in
    profusion, and commonly stuff themselves to such a degree that
    they lose all desire for roving about: so that dog, master, and
    ass, lead a comparatively easy life, and are left to the quiet
    enjoyment of nature. But the lot of the Kanasz is a pitiable
    one when, at the close of summer, he has to drive his swine to
    market. From Debreczin, nay even from the Serbian frontier, he
    has to make a journey on foot more toilsome than was ever
    undertaken by the most adventurous traveler, pacing slowly over
    the interminable heaths in rain, storm, or under a burning sun,
    behind his pigs, which drive into his face hot clouds of dust.
    Every now and then a hog has stuffed itself so full as to be
    unable to stir from the spot; and there it lies on the road
    without moving, whilst the whole caravan is obliged to wait for
    half a day or longer, until the glutted animal can get on his
    legs again; and when at length this feat is accomplished,
    frequently his neighbor begins the same trick. There is truly
    not a more toilsome business in the wide world than that of a
    Kanasz.... The fokos is a hatchet, with a long handle, which
    the Kanasz hurls with great dexterity. Whenever he desires to
    pick out and slaughter one of his hogs, either for his own use
    or for sale, the attempt would be attended with danger, in the
    half-savage state of these animals, without such a weapon. The
    fokos here assists him; which he flings with such force and
    precision, that the sharp iron strikes exactly into the center
    of the frontal bone of the animal he has marked out; the victim
    sinks on the earth without uttering a sound, and the drove
    quietly proceeds on its way. That he can strike down a man with
    equal precision at eighty to a hundred paces, is proved by the
    gallows at the entrance of the forest&mdash;the three-legged
    monument of his dexterity. During recent events, too, the
    surgeons of the Austrian army will readily furnish the Kanasz
    and Csikos with certificates of their ability and skill."</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>THE "WILD HUSSAR" OF HUNGARY.</h2>

    <p>France, Russia, Prussia, and other countries, have
    introduced the Hussars into their armies; but these soldiers
    are merely Russian, French, and Prussian cavalry, dressed in
    the Hungarian laced jacket: they want the spirit, the horse,
    and&mdash;the 'Magyar Isten.' For this reason, the Hungarian
    Hussar will not acknowledge them as brethren; and whenever he
    comes in contact with foreign Hussars, he lets them feel in
    battle the full force of his contempt. A story is told, that
    during a campaign against the French in the war with Napoleon,
    the bivouacs of the Prussian and Hungarian Hussars were near to
    one another. A Prussian came over to his neighbors in a
    familiar way with a glass of wine, and drank it to the health
    of his 'brother hussar.' But the Hungarian gently pushed the
    glass back, and stroked his beard, saying, 'What
    brother?&mdash;no brother&mdash;I hussar&mdash;you
    jack-pudding.'</p>

    <p>This expression is not to be mistaken for a brag. The
    Hungarian hussar is no fanfaron like the French chasseur, but
    he is conscious of his own powers, like a Grenadier of the Old
    Imperial Guard. The dolmany, the csako, and the csizma, have
    grown to his body; they form his holyday dress even when off
    duty&mdash;the national costume transferred into the army; and
    as he is aware that this is not the case in other countries,
    the foreign Hussar's dress is in his eyes a mere servant's
    livery; and logically the man is not altogether wrong.</p>

    <p>The Hussar, like the Magyars in general, is naturally
    good-tempered. The finest man in the service, he is at the same
    time the most jovial companion in the tavern, and will not sit
    by and empty his glass by himself when a Bohemian or German
    comrade at his side has spent all his money. There is only one
    biped under the sun who is in his eyes more contemptible and
    hateful than any animal of marsh or forest. This is the
    Banderial Hussar&mdash;that half-breed between Croat and
    Magyar, that caricature of the true Hussar, who serves in the
    cavalry, as the Croat in the infantry, of the Military
    Frontier. Never was an Hungarian Hussar known to drink with a
    Banderial Hussar; never will he sit at the same table: if he
    meets a snake he crushes it under foot&mdash;a wolf he will
    hunt in the mountains&mdash;with a buffalo he will fight on the
    open heath&mdash;with a miserable horse-stealer he will wrestle
    for a halter; but as for the Banderial Hussar, he spits in his
    face wherever he meets him.</p>

    <p>It was at Hatvan, or at Tapjo-Bicske, that Hungarian and
    Banderial Hussars were for the first time in this war&mdash;the
    first time perhaps in the recollection of man&mdash;opposed to
    one another in battle. If looks could slay, there would have
    been no need of a conflict, for the eyes of the Magyars shot
    death and contempt at their unworthy adversaries. The signal of
    attack sounded; and at the same instant, as if seized by one
    common thought, the Hungarian Hussars clattered their heavy
    sabres back into the scabbard, and with a fearful imprecation,
    such as no German tongue could echo, charged weaponless and at
    full speed their mimic caricatures whom fate had thrown in
    their way. The shock was so irresistible, that the poor Croats
    could make no use of their sabers against the furious onset of
    their unarmed foe: they were beaten down from their saddles
    with the fist, and dragged off their horses by their dolmanys;
    those who could save themselves fled. The Hussars disdained to
    pursue them; but they complained to their Colonel at having
    been opposed to 'such a rabble.'&mdash;<i>Schlesinger</i>.</p>

    <p>The SPANISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES have announced the following
    subject for competition: "An experimental investigation and
    explanation of the theory of nitrification, the causes which
    most influence the production of this phenomenon, and the means
    most conducive in Spain to natural nitrification." The prize,
    to be awarded in May 1851, is to be a gold medal and 6000
    copper reals&mdash;about seventy pounds sterling; and a second
    similar medal will be given to the second best paper. The
    papers, written in Spanish or Latin, are to be sent in before
    the 1st May, with, as usual, the author's name under seal.</p>

    <p>IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TELEGRAPH.&mdash;The <i>Presse</i> gives
    some account of experiments made at the house of M. de
    Girardin, in Paris, with a new telegraphic dictionary, the
    invention of M. Gonon. Dispatches in French, English,
    Portuguese, Russian, and Latin, including proper names of men
    and places, and also figures, were transmitted and translated,
    says this account, with a rapidity and fidelity alike
    marvelous, by an officer who knew nothing of any one of the
    languages used except his own. Dots, commas, accents, and
    breaks were all in their places. This dictionary of M. Gonon is
    applicable alike to electric and aerial telegraphy, to
    transmissions by night and by day, to maritime and to military
    telegraphing. The same paper speaks of the great interest
    excited in the European capitals by the approaching experiment
    of submarine telegraphic communication between England and
    France. The wires, it says, on the English side are deposited
    and ready for laying down. It is probable that in a very few
    days the experiment will be complete.</p>

    <p>NEW ORLEANS AS SEEN BY A GERMAN PRINCE is very naturally not
    quite the same city as in the opinion of her own
    pleasure-loving citizens, nor can the republic whose
    South-western metropolis is condemned with the rigidity of a
    merciless judge and the jaundice of an unfriendly traveler,
    hope to get clear of censure from the same super-royal pen. It
    seems that his serenest highness Major-General Duke Paul
    William, of Wirtemburg, is traveling in America, and that the
    <i>Ausland</i>, a weekly paper, of Stuttgart, is from time to
    time favored with the results of his experience on the way.
    From some recent portions of his correspondence <i>The
    International</i> translates the subjoined <i>morceau</i>,
    which, however, despite its great exaggeration, is not
    altogether devoid of truth: "It is not necessary here to
    mention how much New Orleans has altered, increased, and
    deteriorated, for it is an established thing that cities which
    grow to such gigantic proportions gain nothing in respect to
    the morals of their inhabitants. Here drunkenness and gambling,
    two vices of which the Americans were ignorant in the time of
    the founders of their great federation, have taken very deep
    root. The decrease of the inflexible spirit of religion, and
    the increase of vice and luxury, gnaw the powerful tree, and
    are fearful enemies, which cannot be resisted by a structure
    that might resist with scorn all foreign foes, and would have
    played a mighty part in the world's history had the spirit of
    Washington and Franklin remained with it. The annexation of
    Texas, the war with Mexico, and now the gold of California,
    have transformed the United States. A people which makes
    conquests, loses inward power in proportion to the
    aggrandizement of its volume, and the increase of its external
    enemies."</p>

    <p>AN ARABIAN NEWSPAPER, with the title <i>Mobacher</i>. has
    lately been commenced in Algiers, at the expense of the French
    Government. It is edited in the cabinet of the
    Governor-General, issued weekly, and lithographed, as less
    expensive than printing, which in Arabic types would be quite
    costly. It contains political news from Europe and Africa, the
    latest advices from Constantinople, all those laws and decrees
    of the Government which in any way concern the Arabs, and
    descriptions of such new discoveries and inventions as can be
    made intelligible to the readers for whom it is designed. A
    thousand copies are printed weekly and sent to the chiefs and
    headmen of all the tribes that are under French rule or
    influence. At first it was not read much, but now the vanity of
    the Arabs has been excited by it as a mark of special attention
    from the Governor-General, so that they take it as an honor,
    and a degree of curiosity has been excited to obtain news from
    other parts of the world.</p>

    <p>Within a short time, also, an additional importance has been
    given to the paper by the publication in it of the amount of
    the tribute which each tribe is required to pay to France.
    Formerly this was known only to the chiefs who would
    accordingly exact from their people whatever amount they deemed
    best, under the pretense that it was for the government, while
    the greater part was retained by themselves. These tribes have
    profited greatly by the French conquest; it is estimated that
    of the eighty millions of francs which the army in Algeria
    costs yearly, from twenty to twenty-five millions remain in the
    hands of the Arabs. The Arab sells his corn, dates, horses,
    sheep, the baskets he weaves, &amp;c., to the European
    population, but never buys anything from them in turn, except
    it be arms and powder. The rest of his money he carries home
    and buries where no one knows but himself, so that, if he dies
    suddenly, it is lost. Only the chiefs of the tribe know how to
    extort anything of these hidden sums. According to the most
    moderate estimates the tribes must have from two to three
    hundred millions of French money. The gains which the chiefs
    draw from this wealth is considerable; some of them have from a
    hundred to a hundred and fifty thousand francs income. They are
    beginning to build large houses, and cultivate gardens around
    them, a disposition which the government favors, because it is
    easier to keep tribes in order that are settled and have
    dwellings to lose which they cannot take with them. The
    publication of the tribute in the <i>Mobacher</i>, is, under
    these circumstances, of great value for the Arabs, because it
    enables them, as it were, to supervise their chiefs, and to
    refuse to pay exorbitant taxes laid under pretense of a high
    tribute. This has increased the respect generally felt for the
    paper, though it has not rendered it more a favorite with the
    chiefs. The power of these leaders is very great in the various
    tribes, having been in most cases hereditary, at least since
    the tenth century, and although not always inherited in direct
    line, the tribes have never suffered it to pass into the hands
    of new families. Hitherto nothing has diminished it; the war
    rather gave it new strength, and it is only by means of the
    chiefs that the French can keep Algiers quiet. It would be a
    remarkable fact if the dissolving power of publicity through
    the press should be manifested here as elsewhere, and begin the
    overthrow of the long standing influence exercised by the great
    Arabian families.</p>

    <p>THE LITERATURE OF SOCIALISM occupies the press in France.
    The subject is warmly debated, <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>. In a
    pamphlet called <i>Despotisme ou Socialisme</i>, M. Pompery
    rapidly sketches the alternative which, he says, lies open to
    those who rise against despotism. There are but two religious
    doctrines according to him: the one absolutist, represented by
    De Maistre, and the Catholic school, which is, logically
    enough, desirous of reestablishing the Inquisition; the other
    professed by all the illustrious teachers of mankind, by
    Pythagoras, Jesus, Socrates, Pascal, &amp;c., which, believing
    in the goodness of the Creator and the perfectibility of man,
    endeavors to found upon earth the reign of justice, fraternity,
    and equality. A more important work on Socialism is that of Dr.
    Guepin, of Nantes, <i>Philosophie du Socialisme</i>; and M.
    Lecouturier announces a <i>Science du Socialisme</i>.</p>

    <p>"THE LIFE, CHARACTER, AND GENIUS OF EBENEZER ELLIOTT," is a
    volume by January Searle, author of <i>Leaves from Sherwood
    Forest</i>, &amp;c., who knew the corn-law rhymer well, and has
    been enabled to give very characteristic sketches, original
    descriptions, correspondence, &amp;c. There are in it many
    judiciously selected specimens of Elliott's poems, prose
    productions, and lectures. Mr. Searle observes of him, that "he
    was cradled into poetry by human wrong and misery; and was
    emphatically the bard of poverty&mdash;singing of the poor
    man's loves and sorrows, and denouncing his oppressors." Again:
    "He has one central idea&mdash;terrible and awful in its
    aspect, although beautiful and beneficent in
    spirit&mdash;before which he tries all causes, and men, and
    things. It is the Eternal Idea of Right; his synonyme of God.
    And this idea is perpetually present in his mind, pervades all
    his thoughts, will not be shuffled nor cheated, but demands a
    full satisfaction from all violators of it."</p>

    <p>THE LATE MRS. OSGOOD was in a very remarkable degree
    respected and beloved by those who were admitted to her
    acquaintance. Without envy or jealousy, or any of the
    immoralities of the intellect which most commonly beset writers
    of her sex, she occasioned no enmities and was a party to none,
    but was regarded, especially by the literary women of this
    country, with a feeling of tenderness and devotion probably
    unparalleled in the annals of literature or of society.
    Immediately after her death, therefore, a desire was manifested
    to illustrate the common regard for her by some suitable
    testimonial, and upon consultation, it was decided to publish a
    splendid souvenir, to consist of the gratuitous contributions
    of her friends, and with the profits accruing from its sale to
    erect a monument to her memory in the cemetery of Mount Auburn.
    This gift book, edited by Mrs. Osgood's most intimate friend,
    Mary E. Hewitt, will be published by Mr. Putnam, on the first
    of October, under the title of <i>The Cairn</i>, and it will
    contain original articles by George Aubrey, Lord Bishop of
    Jamaica: the Right Rev. George W. Doane, the Right Rev. Alonzo
    Potter, the Hon. R.H. Walworth, the Hon. J. Leander Starr, the

    <p>THE REV. WALTER COLTON has just published through A.S.
    Barnes &amp; Co. "Three Years in California," a journal of

    have illustrated his genial temper, shrewdness, and skill in
    description and character writing; and this book will increase
    his reputation for these qualities. It contains portraits of
    Capt. Sutter, Col. Fremont, Mr. Gwin, Mr. Wright, Mr. Larkin,

    Colonel Fremont, are in this Gallery. The great artist,
    naturalist, and man of letters, Audubon, is reflected here as
    he appears at the close of the battle, receiving the reverence
    of nations and ages. In the biographical department Mr. Lester
    has evinced very eminent abilities for this kind of writing. He
    seizes the prominent events of history and the strong points of
    character, and presents them with such force and fullness, and
    happy combination, as to make the letter-press as interesting
    and valuable as the engraved portion of the work. We are
    pleased to learn that the Gallery is remarkably successful. No
    publication of equal splendor and expensiveness has ever before
    been so well received in this country. The cost of it is but
    one dollar per number, or twenty dollars for the series of
    twenty-four numbers. It is now half completed.</p>

    <p>M. Max Schlesinger, author of "The War in Hungary, in
    1848-9,"&mdash;a work which, from what we read of it in the
    foreign journals, is much the most striking and attractive of
    all that have appeared upon its subject in English,&mdash;is
    described in the <i>Athenæum</i>, as by birth a Hungarian, by
    the accidents of fortune a German. For some time a resident in
    Prague, and more recently settled in Berlin, he has had
    excellent opportunities of seeing the men and studying the
    questions connected both in the literary and political sense
    with the present movement of ideas and races in Eastern Europe.
    His acquaintance with the aspects of nature in his native
    land&mdash;his knowledge of the peculiar character of its
    inhabitants, their manners, modes of thought and habits of
    life&mdash;his familiarity with past history&mdash;his right
    conception of the leading men in the recent struggle&mdash;are
    all vouched for as "essentially accurate" by no less an
    authority than Count Pulszky. It would be an injustice merely
    to say that M. Schlesinger has given in an original and
    picturesque way a general view of the course of events in the
    late war, more complete and connected than is afforded in any
    account hitherto presented to the public. He has done more: he
    has enabled the German and English reader to understand the
    miracle of a nation of four or five millions of men rising up
    at the command of a great statesman, and doing successful
    battle with the elaborately organized power of a first-class
    European state, shaking it to its very foundations, and
    contending, not without hope, against two mighty military
    empires,&mdash;until the treachery from within paralyzed its
    power of resistance.</p>

    <p>Dr. Mayo's new novel, "The Berber, or the Mountaineer of the
    Atlas," published by Putnam, promises to be scarcely less
    popular than his "Kaloolah." The <i>Evening Post</i> says of
    it: "Kaloolah was a sprightly narrative of the wanderings of a
    Yankee, who seemed to combine in his person the characteristics
    of Robinson Crusoe with those of Baron Munchausen; but the
    Berber professes to be nothing more than a novel; or, as the
    author says in his preface, his principal object has been to
    tell an agreeable story in an agreeable way. In doing so,
    however, an eye has been had to the illustration of Moorish
    manners, customs, history, and geography; to the
    exemplification of Moorish life as it actually is in Barbary in
    the present day, and not as it usually appears in the vague and
    poetic glamour of the common Moorish romance. It has also been
    an object to introduce to the acquaintance of the reader a
    people who have played a most important part in the world's
    history, but of whom very few educated people know anything
    more than the name. As Dr. Mayo has traveled extensively over
    the regions he describes, we presume that his descriptions may
    be taken as true. His account of the Berbers, a tribe of
    ancient Asiatic origin, who inhabit a range of the Atlas, and
    who live a semi-savage life like the Arabs, is minute, and to
    the intelligent reader quite as interesting as the more
    narrative parts of the work. It is, perhaps, the best evidence
    of the merits of the book, that the whole first edition was
    exhausted by orders from the country before the first number
    had appeared in the city."</p>

    lectures on the subject of Italy in the various cities and
    towns of the United States. Col. Forbes was intimately
    connected with the revolutionary chiefs during the brief
    existence of the Roman Republic, and was directly and
    confidently employed by Mazzini. His knowledge of the country,
    its people, its politics, and its recent history, will supply
    him with materials for making his lectures highly interesting

    <p>FRENCH PERIODICALS.&mdash;A Parisian correspondent of the
    London <i>Literary Gazette</i> observes, that if we exclude the
    <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>&mdash;a, sort of cross between the
    English <i>Quarterly</i> and the monthlies,&mdash;if we exclude
    also a few dry scientific periodicals, and one or two
    theatrical or musical newspapers, we shall seek in vain for any
    <i>Quarterly</i>, or <i>Blackwood</i>, or <i>Art Union</i>, or
    <i>Literary Gazette</i>; and that even the periodicals and
    journals which make the nearest approach to the weekly,
    monthly, or quarterly publications of England, are either
    wretched compilations, or abominably ill-written and
    ill-printed. The <i>feuilleton</i> system of the newspapers is
    no doubt the principal cause of the periodical literature being
    in such an extremely low condition. But though literary and
    scientific periodicals be, generally speaking, vile in quality,
    they can at least boast of quantity. There are, it seems, not
    fewer than 300 of one kind or another published in Paris alone.
    Among them are 44 devoted to medicine, chemistry, natural
    science, &amp;c.; 42, trade, commerce, railways,
    advertisements; 34, fashions; 30, law; 22, administration,
    public works, roads, bridges, mines; 19, archæology, history,
    biography, geography, numismatics; 19, public instruction and
    education; 15, agriculture and horticulture; 8, bibliography
    and typography; 10, army and navy; 7, literary; the rest
    theatrical, musical, or of a character too hybrid to be

    large number of maps and engravings on wood; and its notes,
    written with much condensation and perspicuity, are such as are
    necessary for the understanding of the text. Indeed, all that
    is added to the letter of the Bible is legitimate and necessary
    <i>illustration</i>. It is being published in a series of

    <p>THE VIENNA UNIVERSITY, long one of the best in Europe, has
    not been reopened since the insurrection of November, 1848, its
    principal edifice having been occupied as barracks for a
    regiment of soldiers. It is now proposed to restore it to its
    proper use, but great difficulty is experienced in finding
    professors. The old ones are scattered, some as exiles in
    foreign countries, on account of democratic
    opinions,&mdash;some in prison for the same reason, others
    employed elsewhere. Wackernagel, the eminent professor of the
    German Language and Literature at Basle, Switzerland, tempted
    by liberal offers, had promised to come to Vienna, and lend the
    aid of his reputation and talents to the restoration of the
    University, but being lately at Milan, on a wedding tour, as he
    and his wife were passing through the <i>Piazza d'Armi</i>,
    their ears were saluted by cries of pain, which on inquiry they
    found to proceed from sundry rebellious Italians, of both
    sexes, who were receiving each from twenty-five to fifty blows
    of the military baton, or cane, employed by the Austrians in
    flogging soldiers. Madame Wackernagel at once declared that she
    would never willingly inhabit a country whose laws and habits
    suffered women to be so brutally punished for patriotism, and
    her husband could only agree with her. He has accordingly
    broken off the engagement, and the Government cannot hope to

    <p>HINCKS ON LITERARY LARCENY.&mdash;A Canadian friend sends us
    the following extract from a speech by Francis Hincks, a
    leading member of the Canadian Ministry, touching the
    International Copyright question:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The American publisher steals the works of British
        authors, because he is immoral enough to do it, because he
        is scoundrel enough, and the nation is scoundrel enough to
        permit it. (Ironical cheers.) Yes, because the nation is
        scoundrel enough to permit it."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Our unknown friend who sends us this wants us to give Hincks
    a thorough roasting for it, and evidently expects every hair on
    our head to bristle with indignation. Now we have not the least
    objection to roasting the Minister aforesaid, and will do it
    when a fair chance presents itself, but we don't consider this
    such a chance. In fact, though we think Francis has drawn
    rather a strong draught from "the well of English undefiled,"
    yet essentially we regard his observations above quoted as
    rather more than half right. It <i>is</i> rascally to steal a
    man's book, print it, sell it, read it, and refuse him any pay
    for the labor of writing it; and we don't see that his being an
    Englishman makes any material difference. There may be a
    cheaper way to get the proceeds of another man's toil than by
    paying for it, but we don't think there is any other strictly
    honest way.&mdash;<i>Tribune</i>.</p>

    <p>Bavaria is a sort of artists' paradise, both the late King
    Louis and the present Maximilian being determined to leave
    behind them the glory of munificent patrons of art. In this
    they have so far succeeded, that Munich, which before their
    time was by no means among German cities the most worthy a
    traveler's attention, may now dispute the palm even with
    Dresden, notwithstanding the unrivaled gallery of paintings,
    possessed by the latter. For students of modern art, and
    especially of the German schools, Munich is incomparable, while
    its collection of ancient sculptures cannot be equaled out of
    Italy. We now learn that King Maximilian has conceived the plan
    of a grand series of pictures to comprehend the prominent
    epochs and events of history. The most eminent German and
    foreign artists are to be invited to assist in carrying out
    this immense undertaking; so that thus the series will not only
    represent the great experiences of mankind, but will, it is
    hoped, contain specimens of all the great schools of modern
    painting.</p>

    <p>An exhibition of indisputable works by the old painters is
    now open at Valenciennes, in France. It consists of pictures
    belonging to the family of the Belgian general Rottiers. They
    are for sale, either single or together. Among them is a St.
    Denis, bearing his Head, by Rubens, said to have been painted
    by order of Pope Urban VIII. It was deposited in the Convent of
    the <i>Annunciades</i>, at Antioch; in 1747, Louis XV. offered
    100,000 francs for it, but was refused, the convent having no
    right to dispose of it. Afterward, on the suppression of the
    convent, it fell into the hands of the family to which it now
    belongs. The exhibition also contains a landscape by Salvator
    Rosa, representing a scene in the Appenines; a Magdalen
    kneeling in a Cavern, by Kneller; two Allegories, by Giulio
    Romano; several portraits by Rubens and Van Dyke, besides other
    works of less value.</p>

    <p>Darley's "Sleepy Hollow."&mdash;The London Art Journal, for
    July, has the following notice of Mr. Darley's illustrations of
    Irving's "Legends of Sleepy Hollow," published by the
    <i>American Art Union</i>: "The charmingly quaint original
    legend told with so much quiet humor by Washington Irving, is
    here illustrated by a native artist in a congenial spirit, and
    his scenes realized in a manner which must give its author
    satisfaction, and redound to the credit of the designer. We
    have before noticed the great ability exhibited by Mr. Darley
    for the mode of illustration he adopts, which we may add is
    that rendered famous by Retzsh. The series we are now noticing
    are quite as meritorious as that designed by the same artist to
    Rip Van Winkle; but the subject matter is not equally capable
    of such broad contrasts in drollery as that legend presents.
    Nevertheless, Mr. Darley has executed his task in the truest
    appreciation of his author; and his hero is the veritable
    Ichabod Crane of Irving; his love-making scene with "the
    peerless daughter of Van Tassel" is exquisite in its quiet
    humor; so also is the merry-making in the Dutch Farmer's home.
    Altogether, the series is extremely good, and does the greatest
    credit to the designer. American literature thus illustrated by
    American artists cannot fail to achieve honor to that country
    in the old world as well as the new. We believe Mr. Darley, in
    his line, to be as great as any American artist whose works
    have fallen under our notice."</p>

    <p>Chaucer's Monument.&mdash;The <i>Athenæum</i> says, "One of
    the objections formerly urged against taking steps to restore
    the perishing memorial of the Father of English Poetry in
    Poet's Corner was, that it was not really his tomb, but a
    monument erected to do honor to his memory a century and a half
    after his death. An examination, however, of the tomb itself,
    by competent authorities, has proved this objection to be
    unfounded&mdash;inasmuch as there can exist no doubt, we hear,
    from the difference of workmanship, material, &amp;c., that the
    altar tomb is the original tomb of Geoffrey Chaucer,&mdash;and
    that instead of Nicholas Brigham having erected an entirely new
    monument, he only added to that which then existed the
    overhanging canopy, &amp;c. So that the sympathy of Chaucer's
    admirers is now invited to the restoration of what till now was
    really not known to exist&mdash;<i>the original tomb</i> of the
    Poet&mdash;as well as to the additions made to it by the
    affectionate remembrance of Nicholas Brigham."</p>

    <p>Lessing's new picture.&mdash;A letter from Düsseldorf under
    date of 9th July, in the <i>Courier and Enquirer</i>, says that
    Lessing's great painting, "The Martyrdom of Huss," Sad just
    been finished and had been exhibited for the last few days at
    the Academy of Fine Arts, where it was visited by thousands.
    When it became known that orders for its immediate shipment had
    arrived from New York, the desire to obtain a last view of this
    truly great work became so intense that it was found necessary
    to put the Police in requisition to keep back the throng, and
    the gates of the Academy had to be closed. It causes general
    regret that it is to be sent out of the country. The <i>Cologne
    Gazette</i> calls this picture the most sublime production of
    the great artist, and expresses the conviction that a speedy
    fortune might be realized by its exhibition in Europe.</p>

    <p>Mlle. Rachel.&mdash;The wonderful accuracy of the
    death-scene in "Adrienne Lecouvreur" has been the object of
    universal praise in London, not merely from the thrilled and
    thralled public, but from men of art and science. A physician,
    it is said, was complimenting Mademoiselle on her amazing truth
    to the symptoms of mortal agony: "You must have studied death
    closely," said he. "Yes, I have," was the quiet reply; "my
    maid's. I went up to her&mdash;I stayed with her&mdash;she
    recommended her mother to me!&mdash;I was studying my part."
    This is probably merely one of those cynical stories with which
    the sharp people of Paris love to environ and encircle every
    one who stands a dangerous chance of becoming too popular. But
    smaller artists than Mademoiselle Rachel have sometimes had
    recourse to curious expedients to give their dramatic
    personations a show at reality. The French <i>prima donna</i>,
    who not very long ago appeared in M. Clapisson's poor opera,
    "Jeanne la Folle," is said to have shut herself up in the
    <i>Salpêtrière</i>, by way of studying <i>her</i> part, and to
    have been rewarded for her zealous curiosity by receiving a
    basin of scalding soup dashed in her face by one of the poor
    miserable objects of her examination.</p>

    striking phrenology with great force and with pleasing as well

    truthful, in detail, and is in an eminent degree
    characteristic. The admirers of that author who have not seen
    him will find in it their ideal, and all his acquaintances will
    see in it as distinctly the real man who sits in the congress
    of editors as the representative of the polite world. The head
    of the artist Mount, after Elliott, is not by any means less
    successful. Among the other portraits are those of Gen. Scott,

    <h2>WORDSWORTH'S POSTHUMOUS POEM.<a id="footnotetag3"
       name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a></h2>

    <p>This is a voice that speaks to us across a gulf of nearly
    fifty years. A few months ago Wordsworth was taken from us at
    the ripe age of fourscore, yet here we have him addressing the
    public, as for the first time, with all the fervor, the unworn
    freshness, the hopeful confidence of thirty. We are carried
    back to the period when Coleridge, Byron, Scott, Rogers, and
    Moore were in their youthful prime. We live again in the
    stirring days when the poets who divided public attention and
    interest with the Fabian struggle in Portugal and Spain, with
    the wild and terrible events of the Russian campaign, with the
    uprising of the Teutonic nations and the overthrow of Napoleon,
    were in a manner but commencing their cycle of songs. This is
    to renew, to antedate, the youth of a majority of the living
    generation. But only those whose memory still carries them so
    far back, can feel within them any reflex of that eager
    excitement with which the news of battles fought and won, or
    mailcoach copies of some new work of Scott, or Byron, or the
    <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, were looked for and received in those
    already old days.</p>

    <p>We need not remind the readers of the <i>Excursion</i> that
    when Wordsworth was enabled by the generous enthusiasm of
    Raisley Calvert to retire with a slender independence to his
    native mountains, there to devote himself exclusively to his
    art, his first step was to review and record in verse the
    origin and progress of his own powers, as far as he was
    acquainted with them. This was at once an exercise in
    versification, and a test for the kind of poetry for which he
    was by temperament fitted. The result was a determination to
    compose a philosophical poem containing views of man, of
    nature, and of society. This, ambitious conception has been
    doomed to share the fate of so many other colossal
    undertakings. Of the three parts of his <i>Recluse</i>, thus
    planned, only the second, (the <i>Excursion</i>, published in
    1814,) has been completed. Of the other two there exists only
    the first book of the first, and the plan of the third. The
    <i>Recluse</i> will remain in fragmentary greatness, a poetical
    Cathedral of Cologne.</p>

    <p>Matters standing thus, it has not been without a melancholy
    sense of the uncertainty of human projects, and of the contrast
    between the sanguine enterprise and its silent evaporation (so
    often the "history of an individual mind"), that we have
    perused this <i>Prelude</i> which no completed strain was
    destined to follow. Yet in the poem itself there is nothing to
    inspire depression. It is animated throughout with the hopeful
    confidence in the poet's own powers, so natural to the time of
    life at which it was composed; it evinces a power and soar of
    imagination unsurpassed in any of his writings; and its images
    and incidents have a freshness and distinctness which they not
    seldom lost, when they came to be elaborated, as many of them
    were, in his minor poems of a later date.</p>

    <p>The <i>Prelude</i>, as the title-page indicates, is a
    poetical autobiography, commencing with the earliest
    reminiscences of the author, and continued to the time at which
    it was composed. We are told that it was begun in 1799 and
    completed, in 1805. It consists of fourteen books. Two are
    devoted to the infancy and school-time of the poet; four to the
    period of his University life; two to a brief residence in
    London immediately subsequent to his leaving Cambridge, and a
    retrospect of the progress his mind had then made; and three to
    a residence in France, chiefly in the Loire, but partly in
    Paris, during the stormy period of Louis the Sixteenth's flight
    and capture, and the fierce contest between the Girondins and
    Robespierre. Five books are then occupied with an analysis of
    the internal struggle occasioned by the contradictory
    influences of rural and secluded nature in boyhood, and of
    society when the young man first mingles with the world. The
    surcease of the strife is recorded in the fourteenth book,
    entitled "Conclusion."</p>

    <p>The poem is addressed to Coleridge; and apart from its
    poetical merits, is interesting as at once a counterpart and a
    supplement to that author's philosophical and beautiful
    criticism of the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> in his <i>Biographia
    Literaria</i>. It completes the explanation, there given, of
    the peculiar constitution of Wordsworth's mind, and of his
    poetical theory. It confirms and justifies our opinion that
    that theory was essentially partial and erroneous; but at the
    same time it establishes the fact that Wordsworth was a true
    and a great poet in despite of his theory.</p>

    <p>The great defect of Wordsworth, in our judgment, was want of
    sympathy with and knowledge of men. From his birth till his
    entry at college, he lived in a region where he met with none
    whose minds might awaken his sympathies, and where life was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page272"
       id="page272"></a>[pg 272]</span> altogether uneventful. On
       the other hand, that region abounded with the inert,
       striking, and most impressive objects of natural scenery.
       The elementary grandeur and beauty of external nature came
       thus to fill up his mind to the exclusion of human
       interests. To such a result his individual constitution
       powerfully contributed. The sensuous element was singularly
       deficient in his nature. He never seems to have passed
       through that erotic period out of which some poets have
       never emerged. A soaring, speculative imagination, and an
       impetuous, resistless self-will, were his distinguishing
       characteristics. From first to last he concentrated himself
       within himself; brooding over his own fancies and
       imaginations to the comparative disregard of the incidents
       and impressions which suggested them; and was little
       susceptible of ideas originating in other minds. We behold
       the result. He lives alone in a world of mountains, streams,
       and atmospheric phenomena, dealing with moral abstractions,
       and rarely encountered by even shadowy specters of beings
       outwardly resembling himself. There is measureless grandeur
       and power in his moral speculations. There is intense
       reality in his pictures of external nature. But though his
       human characters are presented with great skill of
       metaphysical analysis, they have rarely life or animation.
       He is always the prominent, often the exclusive, object of
       his own song.</p>

    <p>Upon a mind so constituted, with its psychological
    peculiarities so cherished and confirmed, the fortunes and
    fates of others, and the stirring events of his time, made
    vivid but very transient impressions. The conversation and
    writing of contemporaries trained among books, and with the
    faculty of speech more fully developed than that of thought,
    seemed colorless and empty to one with&mdash;whom natural
    objects and grandeurs were always present in such overpowering
    force. Excluded by his social position from taking an active
    part in the public events of the day, and repelled by the
    emptiness of the then fashionable literature, he turned to
    private and humble life as possessing at least a reality. But
    he thus withheld himself from the contemplation of those great
    mental excitements which only great public struggles can
    awaken. He contracted a habit of exaggerating the importance of
    every-day incidents and emotions. He accustomed himself to see
    in men and in social relations only what he was predetermined
    to see there, and to impute to them a value and importance
    derived mainly from his own self-will. Even his natural good
    taste contributed to confirm him in his error. The two
    prevailing schools of literature in England, at that time, were
    the trashy and mouthing writers who adopted the sounding
    language of Johnson and Darwin, unenlivened by the vigorous
    thought of either; and the "dead-sea apes" of that inflated,
    sentimental, revolutionary style which Diderot had
    unconsciously originated, and Kotzebue carried beyond the verge
    of caricature. The right feeling and manly thought of
    Wordsworth were disgusted by these shallow word-mongers, and he
    flew to the other extreme. Under the influences&mdash;repulsive
    and attractive&mdash;we have thus attempted to indicate, he
    adopted the theory that as much of grandeur and profound
    emotion was to be found in mere domestic incidents and
    feelings, as on the more conspicuous stage of public life; and
    that a bald and naked simplicity of language was the perfection
    of style. Singularly enough, he was confirmed in these notions
    by the very writer of the day whose own natural genius, more
    than any of his contemporaries, impelled him to revel in great,
    wild, supernatural conceptions; and to give utterance to them
    in gorgeous language. Coleridge was perhaps the only
    contemporary from whom Wordsworth ever took an opinion; and
    that he did so from him, is mainly attributable to the fact
    that Coleridge did little more than reproduce to him his own
    notions, sometimes rectified by a subtler logic, but always
    rendered more attractive by new and dazzling illustrations.</p>

    <p>Fortunately it is out of the power of the most perverse
    theory to spoil the true poet. The poems of Wordsworth must
    continue to charm and elevate mankind, in defiance of his
    crotchets, just as Luther, Henri Quatre, and other living
    impersonations of poetry do, despite all quaint peculiarities
    of the attire, the customs, or the opinions of their respective
    ages, with which they were imbued. The spirit of truth and
    poetry redeems, ennobles, hallows, every external form in which
    it may be lodged. We may "pshaw" and "pooh" at Harry Gill and
    the Idiot Boy; but the deep and tremulous tenderness of
    sentiment, the strong-winged flight of fancy, the excelling and
    unvarying purity, which pervade all the writings of Wordsworth,
    and the exquisite melody of his lyrical poems, must ever
    continue to attract and purify the mind. The very excesses into
    which his one-sided theory betrayed him, acted as a useful
    counter-agent to the prevailing bad taste of his time.</p>

    <p>The Prelude may take a permanent place as one of the most
    perfect of his compositions. It has much of the fearless
    felicity of youth; and its imagery has the sharp and vivid
    outline of ideas fresh from the brain. The subject&mdash;the
    development of his own great powers&mdash;raises him above that
    willful dallying with trivialties which repels us in some of
    his other works. And there is real vitality in the theme, both
    from our anxiety to know the course of such a mind, and from
    the effect of an absorbing interest in himself excluding that
    languor which sometimes seized him in his efforts to impart or
    attribute interest to themes possessing little or none in
    themselves. Its mere narrative, though often very homely, and
    dealing in too many words, is often characterized also by
    elevated imagination, and always by eloquence. The bustle of
    London life, the prosaic uncouthness of its exterior, the
    earnest heart that beats beneath it, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page273"
       id="page273"></a>[pg 273]</span> details even of its
       commonest amusements, from Bartholomew Fair to Sadler's
       Wells, are portrayed with simple force and delicate
       discrimination; and for the most part skillfully contrasted
       with the rural life of the poet's native home. There are
       some truthful and powerful sketches of French character and
       life, in the early revolutionary era. But above all, as
       might have been anticipated, Wordsworth's heart revels in
       the elementary beauty and grandeur of his mountain theme;
       while his own simple history is traced with minute fidelity,
       and is full of unflagging interest.</p>

    <p>We have already adverted to the fact that this Prelude was
    but the overture to a grander song which the poet has left, in
    a great measure, unsung. Reverting to this consideration an
    important fact seems to force itself upon our notice. The
    creative power of Wordsworth would appear to have been
    paralyzed after the publication of his Excursion. All his most
    finished works precede that period. His later writings
    generally lack the strength and freshness which we find in
    those of an earlier date. Some may attribute this to his want
    of the stimulus which the necessity of writing for a livelihood
    imparts, and in part they may be right; but this is not the
    whole secret. That his isolation from the stirring contact of
    competition, that his utter disregard of contemporary events,
    allowed his mind, which for perfect health's sake requires
    constantly-renewed impulses from without, to subside into
    comparative hebetude, there can be no doubt whatever. But the
    main secret of the freezing up of his fountain of poetical
    inspiration, we really take to have been his change of
    politics. Wordsworth's muse was essentially liberal&mdash;one
    may say, Jacobinical. That he was unconscious of any sordid
    motive for his change, we sincerely believe; but as certainly
    his conforming was the result less of reasonable conviction
    than of willfulness. It was by a determined effort of his will
    that he brought himself, to believe in the Church-and-State
    notions which he latterly promulgated. Hence the want of
    definite views, and of a living interest, which characterizes
    all his writings subsequent to that change, when compared with
    those of an earlier time. It was Wordsworth's wayward fate to
    be patronized and puffed into notice by the champions of old
    abuses, by the advocates of the pedantry of Oxford, and by the
    maintainers of the despotism not even of Pitt but of
    Castlereagh. It is already felt, however, that the poet whom
    these men were mainly instrumental in bringing into notice,
    will live in men's memories by exactly those of his writings
    most powerful to undermine and overthrow their dull and faded
    bigotries. Despite his own efforts, Wordsworth (as has been
    said of Napoleon) is the child and champion of Jacobinism.
    Though clothed in ecclesiastical formulas, his religion is
    little more than the simple worship of nature; his noblest
    moral flights are struggles to emancipate himself from
    conventional usage; and the strong ground of his thoughts, as
    of his style, is nature stripped of the gauds with which the
    pupils of courts and circles would bedeck and be-ribbon it.
    Even in the ranks of our opponents Wordsworth has been laboring
    in our behalf.</p>

    <p>It is in the record of his extra-academic life that the poet
    soars his freest flight, in passages where we have a very echo
    of the emotions of an emancipated worshiper of nature flying
    back to his loved resorts. Apart from its poetic value, the
    book is a graphical and interesting portraiture of the
    struggles of an ingenuous and impetuous mind to arrive at a
    clear insight into its own interior constitution and external
    relations, and to secure the composure of self-knowledge and of
    equally adjusted aspirations. As a poem it is likely to lay
    fast and enduring hold on pure and aspiring intellects, and to
    strengthen the claim of Wordsworth to endure with his land's
    language.</p>

    <h2>THE MONUMENT TO SIR ROBERT PEEL.</h2>

    <h3>A LETTER FROM WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR,</h3>

    <h4>TO THE EDITOR OF THE 'EXAMINER.'</h4>

    <p>Now the fever hath somewhat subsided which came over the
    people from the grave of Sir Robert Peel, there is room for a
    few observations on his decease and on its consequences. All
    public writers, I believe, have expatiated on his character,
    comparing him with others who, within our times, have occupied
    the same position. My own opinion has invariably been that he
    was the wisest of all our statesmen; and certainly, though he
    found reason to change his sentiments and his measures, he
    changed them honestly, well weighed, always from conviction,
    and always for the better. He has been compared, and seemingly
    in no spirit of hostility or derision, with a Castlereagh, a
    Perceval, an Addington. a Canning. Only one of these is worthy
    of notice, namely Canning, whose brilliancy made his
    shallowness less visible, and whose graces, of style and
    elocution threw a vail over his unsoundness and lubricity. Sir
    Robert Peel was no satirist or epigrammatist: he was only a
    statesman in public life: only a virtuous and friendly man in
    private. <i>Par negotiis, nee supra</i>. Walpole alone
    possessed his talents for business. But neither Peel nor his
    family was enriched from the spoils of his country; Walpole
    spent in building and pictures more than double the value of
    his hereditary estate, and left the quadruple to his
    descendants.</p>

    <p>Dissimilar from Walpole, and from commoner and coarser men
    who occupied the same office, Peel forbade that a name which he
    had made illustrious should be degraded and stigmatized by any
    title of nobility. For he knew that all those titles had their
    origin and nomenclature from military services, and belong to
    military men, like their epaulets and spurs and chargers. They
    sound well enough against the sword and helmet, but strangely
    in law-courts and cathedrals: but, reformer as he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page274"
       id="page274"></a>[pg 274]</span> was, he could not reform
       all this; he could only keep clear of it in his own
       person.</p>

    <p>I now come to the main object of my letter.</p>

    <p>Subscriptions are advertised for the purpose of raising
    monuments to Sir Robert Peel; and a motion has been made in
    Parliament for one in Westminster Abbey at the public expense,
    Whatever may be the precedents, surely the house of God should
    contain no object but such as may remind us of His presence and
    our duty to Him. Long ago I proposed that ranges of statues and
    busts should commemorate the great worthies of our country. All
    the lower part of our National Gallery might be laid open for
    this purpose. Even the best monuments in Westminster Abbey and
    St. Paul's are deformities to the edifice. Let us not continue
    this disgrace. Deficient as we are in architects, we have many
    good statuaries, and we might well employ them on the statues
    of illustrious commanders, and the busts of illustrious
    statesmen and writers. Meanwhile our cities, and especially the
    commercial, would, I am convinced, act more wisely, and more
    satisfactorily to the relict of the deceased, if, instead of
    statues, they erected schools and almshouses, with an
    inscription to his memory.</p>

    <p>We glory in about sixty whose busts and statues may occupy
    what are now the "deep solitudes and awful cells" in our
    national gallery. Our literary men of eminence are happily more
    numerous than the political or the warlike, or both together.
    There is only one class of them which might be advantageously
    excluded, namely, the theological; and my reasons are these.
    First, their great talents were chiefly employed on
    controversy; secondly, and consequently, their images would
    excite dogmatical discord. Every sect of the Anglican Church,
    and every class of dissenters, complaining of undue
    preferences. Painture and sculpture lived in the midst of
    corruption, lived throughout it, and seemed indeed to draw
    vitality from it, as flowers the most delicate from noxious
    air; but they collapsed at the searching breath of free
    inquiry, and could not abide persecution. The torch of
    Philosophy never kindled the suffocating fagot, under whose
    smoke Theology was mistaken for Religion. Theology had, until
    now, been speculative and quiescent: she abandoned to
    Philosophy these humbler qualities: instead of allaying and
    dissipating, as Philosophy had always done, she excited and she
    directed animosities. Oriental in her parentage, and keeping up
    her wide connections in that country, she acquired there all
    the artifices most necessary to the furtherance of her designs:
    among the rest was ventriloquism, which she quite perfected,
    making her words seem to sound from above and from below and
    from every side around. Ultimately, when men had fallen on
    their faces at this miracle, she assumed the supreme power.
    Kings were her lackeys, and nations the dust under her
    palfrey's hoof. By her sentence Truth was gagged, scourged,
    branded, cast down on the earth in manacles; and Fortitude, who
    had stood at Truth's side, was fastened with nails and pulleys
    to the stake. I would not revive by any images, in the abode of
    the graceful and the gentle Arts, these sorrowful
    reminiscences. The vicissitudes of the world appear to be
    bringing round again the spectral Past. Let us place great men
    between it and ourselves: they all are tutelar: not the warrior
    and the statesman only; not only the philosopher; but also the
    historian who follows them step by step, and the poet who
    secures us from peril and dejection by his counter-charm.
    Philosophers in most places are unwelcome: but there is no
    better reason why Shaftesbury and Hobbes should be excluded
    from our gallery, than why Epicurus should have been from
    Cicero's or Zeno from Lucullus's. Of our sovereigns, I think
    Alfred, Cromwell, and William III alone are eligible; and they,
    because they opposed successfully the subverters of the laws.
    Three viceroys of Ireland will deservedly be placed in the same
    receptacle; Sir John Perrot, Lord Chesterfield, and (in due
    time) the last Lord-Deputy. One Speaker, one only, of the
    Parliament; he without whom no Parliament would be now
    existing; he who declared to Henry IV. that until all public
    grievances were removed, no subsidy should be granted. The name
    of this Speaker may be found in Rapin; English historians talk
    about facts, forgetting men.</p>

    <p>Admirals and generals are numerous and conspicuous. Drake,
    Blake, Rodney, Jervis, Nelson, Collingwood; the subduer of
    Algiers beaten down for the French to occupy: and the defender
    of Acre, the first who defeated, discomfited, routed, broke,
    and threw into shameful flight, Bonaparte. Our generals are
    Marlborough, Peterborough, Wellington, and that successor to
    his fame in India, who established the empire that was falling
    from us, who achieved in a few days two arduous victories, who
    never failed in any enterprise, who accomplished the most
    difficult with the smallest expenditure of blood, who corrected
    the disorders of the military, who gave the soldier an example
    of temperance, the civilian of simplicity and frugality, and
    whose sole (but exceedingly great) reward, was the approbation
    of our greatest man.</p>

    <p>With these come the statesmen of the Commonwealth, the
    students of Bacon, the readers of Philip Sidney, the companions
    of Algernon, the precursors of Locke and Newton. Opposite to
    them are Chaucer, Spenser, Shakspeare, Milton; lower in
    dignity, Dryden, Pope, Gray, Goldsmith, Cowper, Scott, Burns,
    Shelley, Southey, Byron, Wordsworth; the author of
    <i>Hohenlinden</i> and the <i>Battle of the Baltic</i>; and the
    glorious woman who equaled these, two animated works in her
    <i>Ivan</i> and <i>Casabianca</i>. Historians have but recently
    risen up among us: and long be it before, by command of
    Parliament, the chisel grates on the brow of a Napier, a Grote,
    and Macaulay!</p>

    <h2>JURISPRUDENCE OF THE MOGULS: THE PANDECTS OF
    AURUNGZEBE.<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a></h2>

    <p>THE Government of British India have not neglected to
    countenance the study of the indigenous and other systems of
    law which they found established on acquiring possession of the
    country. Warren Hastings was the first to recognize the value
    of such knowledge; and to his encouragement, if not to his
    incitement, we are indebted for the compilation of Hindoo law
    translated by Halbed, Jones, Colebrooke, Macnaghten, Hamilton,
    and a pretty numerous body of accomplished men, of whom Mr.
    Baillie is the most recently enrolled laborer in the vineyard,
    have carried on the good work. More comprehensive and accurate
    views of Hindoo law have gradually been developed, and the more
    advanced and more influential system of Mahometan jurisprudence
    has also shared in the attention of European students. There
    is, however, still much to be done in this field of inquiry; as
    a few remarks on the nature of the present publication, and the
    source whence its materials are derived, will show.</p>

    <p>The law of Mahometan jurists is for India pretty much what
    the Roman law is for Scotland and the Continental nations of
    Europe. Savigny has shown how, throughout all the territories
    formerly included within the limits of the Roman Empire, a
    large amount of Roman legal doctrines and forms of procedure
    continued to be operative after the Empire's subversion. The
    revival of the study of the Roman law, as embodied in the
    compilations of Justinian, by the doctors of the school of
    Bologna, augmented and systematized these remnants of Roman
    jurisprudence, and extended their application to countries
    which (like great part of Germany) had never been subjected to
    the sway of Rome. In like manner, throughout that part of India
    which was permanently subdued and organized by the Mogul
    dynasty, and also those parts in which minor Islamitic states
    were established, the organization of the courts of justice,
    and the legal opinions of the individuals who officiated in
    them, necessarily introduced a large amount of Mahometan
    jurisprudence. This element of the law of India was augmented
    and systematized by the writings of private jurists, and by
    compilations undertaken by command of princes. As with the
    Roman jurisprudence in Europe, so with Mahometan jurisprudence
    in India, only so much of its doctrines and forms could at any
    time be considered to possess legal force as had been reenacted
    by the local sovereigns, or introduced by judges in the form of
    decisions. A systematic knowledge of the whole body of
    Mahometan law was important to the Indian lawyer, as enabling
    him more thoroughly to understand the system, and its various
    isolated doctrines; but the whole body of that law was at no
    time binding in India. Since the establishment of British sway,
    only so much of the Mahometan law as has kept its ground in the
    practice of the courts, or has been reenacted by the
    "regulations" or "ordinances" of the Anglo-Indian Government,
    <i>is law</i>; the rest is only valuable as the "antiquities of
    the law," which help to trace the origin of what survives, and
    thereby throw light upon what in it is obscure or doubtful.</p>

    <p>Among the most valuable, if not indeed the most valuable of
    the compilations from which we may obtain a knowledge of
    Mahometan jurisprudence, is the "Futawa Alumgeeree," mentioned
    in Mr. Baillie's title-page. Its value is not confined to the
    purposes of those who would make themselves acquainted with
    Mahometan jurisprudence in the peculiar form it assumed in
    India. It is highly esteemed throughout Islam, and is quoted
    even by the doctors of Mecca as the Futawa-i-hind, or the
    Indian <i>responsa prudentum</i>. It was compiled by the orders
    of the Emperor Aurungzebe. It is a digest of the "Futawa" of
    the most celebrated jurists of the Hanifeh (or, as Mr. Baillie
    spells it, <i>Hunefeeah</i>) sect or school. Mr. Baillie
    informs us in his preface, that "<i>futawa</i> is the plural
    form of <i>futwa</i>, a term in common use in Mahometan
    countries to signify an exposition of law by a public officer
    called the <i>mooftee</i>, or a case submitted to him by the
    <i>kazee</i> or judge." The "futwa," therefore, seems to
    correspond not so much with our English "decisions" or
    "precedents" as with the "responsa prudentum," that fertile
    source of doctrines in the Roman law. The "Futawa Alumgeeree"
    consequently resembles the Pandects of Justinian in being a
    systematical arrangement of selections from juridical
    authorities&mdash;compiled by Imperial authority; but differs
    from it in this, that the selections are made exclusively from
    the "responsa prudentum," and a few legal treatises, whereas
    Justinian's digest combined with those excerpts from judicial
    decisions, prætorian edicts, &amp;c. With this distinction, we
    may regard the "Futawa Alumgeeree" as the Pandects or Digest of
    Mahometan Law. As in the Roman work of that name, to each
    extract is appended the name of the original work from which it
    is taken; and the whole of them are so arranged as to form a
    complete digest of Mahometan law.</p>

    <p>A work of this kind is invaluable to the student who would
    make himself master of Mahometan jurisprudence as a system. But
    great care must be taken not to misapprehend the exact nature
    of the knowledge to be obtained from it. The "Futawa
    Alumgeeree" is a systematic exposition of the principles of
    Mahometan law; it assuredly does not enable us to ascertain
    what doctrines of that law are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page276"
       id="page276"></a>[pg 276]</span> now of legal force in
       India, or even what doctrines have at any time had force in
       India. It does not appear to have been Aurungzebe's
       intention to promulgate it as a code, but to present it to
       lawyers as a complete text-book. Even if he did by ordinance
       attribute to it the power of law, such ordinance was only
       effectual at any time in the provinces of the Mogul Empire;
       and since the disruption of that empire, it has been
       superseded and modified by laws and the practice of
       law-courts in the various independent states erected on its
       ruins.</p>

    <p>Again the general scholar must be on his guard against the
    delusion that he will find in this digest materials
    illustrative of the social condition of India under the Mogul
    dynasty. The juridical works excerpted in it are almost all
    foreign to Hindostan; the special cases illustrative of
    abstract doctrines are taken from other countries, and many of
    them from ages antecedent to the invasion of India by the
    Moguls.</p>

    <p>Though Persian was the court language of the Mogul dynasty,
    there is scarcely any Persian element in Aurungzebe's legal
    compilation. The Shiite views of jurisprudence, as of theology,
    prevailed in Persia; the "Futawa Alumgeeree" is strictly
    Sunnite. It is not difficult to account for this.&mdash;The
    Mahometan conquerors of India were mainly of Turkish or Tartar
    race; they came from Turan, a region which from time immemorial
    has stood in antagonistic relations to Iran or Persia. This may
    account for the fact that the races of Turan which have
    embraced Mahometanism have uniformly adhered to the Sunnite
    sect&mdash;the sect most hostile to the Persian Shias&mdash;not
    only when they settled in the countries where the Sunnite sect
    originated, but when they remained in their native regions. The
    views of the Sunnites were first promulgated and have prevailed
    most extensively in those regions of Islam which were once part
    of the Roman empire, which nominally at least was Christian;
    those of the Shiites, in the countries where, under the
    Sassanides and Arsacidæ, the doctrines of Zoroaster
    predominated. The Euphrates forms pretty nearly the line of
    demarkation between them.</p>

    <p>The Caliphs dominated over both countries and over both
    sects. Under their orthodox protection the Sunnite doctrines
    were able to strike root in Balkh and Samarkand&mdash;the
    ancient Turan, and therefore hostile to Iran and Persia. When
    Islam was reorganized after the anarchy which ensued upon the
    overthrow of the Caliphs, Persia became the appanage of the
    Sophis or Shiite dynasty; the regions to the West of the
    Euphrates&mdash;the ci-devant Roman Empire&mdash;acknowledged
    the rule of the Turkish dynasties, which were Sunnite. On the
    Oxus and further East&mdash;the old Turan&mdash;the Sunnite
    sect was sufficiently strong to defy the efforts of the Shiite
    sovereigns of Persia to eradicate it. The doctors of Samarkand
    and Bokhara continued (and continue) as orthodox Sunnites as
    those of Kufah, Mecca, and Stamboul.</p>

    <p>Accordingly, we find the authorities excerpted in the
    "Futawa Alumgeeree" consist almost exclusively of two classes;
    they are either the immediate disciples of Hanifa at Kufah and
    Bagdad, or the jurists of Samarkand and Bokhara. The law-cases
    they expounded are such as had originated, or might have
    originated, in those countries&mdash;in Babylonia or Turan. And
    they are for the most part taken from a state of society, and
    illustrative of social relations, which prevailed in these
    countries at a period long antecedent to that of Aurunzebe. To
    attempt to illustrate the civil and social condition of India,
    under that Emperor by their aid, would be as preposterous as to
    attempt to illustrate the civil and social condition of those
    parts of Germany where the Roman law still possesses authority
    from cases recorded in the Pandects of Justinian.</p>

    <p>The real use and value of the "Futawa Alumgeeree" may be
    briefly explained. In every country in Europe where the Roman
    law is still recognized as more or less authoritative&mdash;and
    indeed in every country where the common law has borrowed more
    or less from the Roman&mdash;an acquaintance with the system of
    Roman jurisprudence as it is embodied in the law-books of
    Justinian has its value for the scientific lawyer. In like
    manner a knowledge of Mahometan jurisprudence as embodied in
    the "Futawa Alumgeeree" cannot fail to be instructive for the
    lawyers of all the countries of Islam, and the lawyers of
    India, where so much of the existing practical law has been
    derived from that source. To the general scholar who wishes to
    master the civil history of Arabia and Babylonia, in which the
    Sunnite sect, and more particularly the Hanifite subdivision of
    it, originated, or to familiarize himself with the moral
    theories which regulate the judgments and actions of the modern
    Turks, Turcomans, Arabians, and Egyptians, the digest of
    Aurungzeebee is also a valuable repertory of facts and
    illustrations.</p>

    <p>For this reason we incline to be of opinion that Mr. Baillie
    is mistaken in thinking that a selection from the two books of
    the "Futawa Alumgeeree," which embrace the subject of "sale"
    can have much utility for Indian practitioners. It does not
    follow, because a legal doctrine is declared sound in this
    work, that it is or ever has been practically applicable in
    India. As an authoritative declaration of legal doctrines, the
    book is as likely to mislead as to guide aright. On the other
    hand, as an exposition of the general principles of Mahometan
    law, even with regard to sale, it is necessarily imperfect. The
    work from which it is taken is a collection of legal opinions,
    which had in their day the force of judicial decisions&mdash;of
    something equivalent to the "responsa prudentum" of Roman
    jurisprudence. Each is expounded on its own merits; and all the
    special doctrines involved
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"
       id="page277"></a>[pg 277]</span> in it are laid down. Hence
       it comes, that much that is calculated to throw light on the
       principles of the law of sale must be sought under other
       heads; and that much included in the chapters ostensibly
       treating of sale refers to other topics. As part of an
       entire digest of the law compiled on the same principle as
       that of Justinian, the two books relating to sale are
       sufficient; but for an isolated treatise on "sale," they
       contain at once too much and too little.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, we welcome Mr. Baillie's publication as a
    valuable addition to juridical and even to general literature.
    The translation, though not by any means free from defects, is
    the best specimen of a really good Mahometan law-book that has
    yet been published. The defects to which we allude are twofold.
    In the first place, though Mr. Baillie mentions that in the
    original the name of the treatise from which it is taken is
    appended to every excerpt, he has not in his translation given
    those references. His work is not therefore what the original
    is, a Chrestomathia of the best Arabian jurists&mdash;a
    succedaneum for their complete works&mdash;an illustration of
    Arabic legal literature. Again, he is often loose and
    vacillating in the use of the English words he has selected as
    corresponding to the technical phraseology of the Arabian
    jurists, and sometimes infelicitous in the selection of his
    English terms. It has occurred to us that he would have
    succeeded better in rendering the exact meaning of his
    originals, had he availed himself more of technical phrases of
    the Roman law which are familiar to all European jurists. Is
    does not occur to us that he would by doing so have been in
    danger of Romanizing the Mahometan to an extent that might
    mislead. Mill, in his History of British India, has noticed how
    closely the classification of the Mahometan approaches to that
    of the Roman jurists. An attentive perusal of Mr. Baillie's
    volume has convinced us that the analogy in the substance is
    quite as strong as in the arrangements. This fact seems
    susceptible of being accounted for on historical grounds.
    Mahometanism is in fact a sect or heresy of Christianity. The
    views and sentiments, the aggregate of which make up the body
    of Christian opinion, are not all of Jewish or Christian
    origin. They are the moral creed of societies whose opinions
    and civilization have been derived in part from other sources.
    The philosophy of Greece and the law of Rome have contributed
    in nearly equal proportions to the theosophy of the Hebrews.
    The jurisprudence of all Christian nations is mainly referable
    to Rome for its origin, and the same is the case with at least
    the Sunnite Mahometans. The nations of Islam took only their
    religious creed from their Prophet; the jurists of Kufah
    retained and expounded the civil law which prevailed among them
    before his time. That law was the law of the Greek Empire,
    developed in the same way as that of the Western Empire under
    the judicial and legislative auspices of Roman Prætors and
    Pro-Consuls, aided by Roman jurists. Theophilus, one of the
    jurists employed by Justinian for his compilations, lectured in
    Greek on the Institutions; and the substance of his lectures
    still survives under the name of the Paraphrase of Theophilus.
    The Greek edicts and novels of Justinian's successors are
    mainly Roman law. Throughout the Byzantine Empire (within which
    Kufah and the region where Bagdad now stands were included)
    Roman law was paramount, and Roman jurists were numerous. The
    arrangement, the subdivisions, and the substance of Mahometan
    jurisprudence, show that it has been principally derived from
    this source. Some of its doctrines are doubtless aboriginal
    engrafted on the law of the Empire; and it has been modified in
    some respects to reconcile it to the religious dictates of
    Islam, just as the law of Pagan Rome was modified after
    Christianity became the religion of the Empire. But still
    Mahometan jurisprudence retains undeniably the lineaments of
    its parentage.</p>

    <p>This consideration places in a strong light the importance
    of the study of Mahometan law. The increasing intimacy of our
    relations with independent Mahometan states makes it of the
    utmost consequence that we should entertain correct views of
    their opinions and institutions; and no better key to the
    knowledge of both can be found than in the historical study of
    their law. Again, we are called upon to legislate and supply
    judges for British India, a large proportion of the inhabitants
    of which are Mahometans. Even the Hindoos of the former Mogul
    Empire have adopted many legal forms and doctrines from their
    conquerors. A minute and accurate acquaintance with Mahometan
    jurisprudence is an indispensable preliminary to judicious
    legislation for British India. For these reasons, it could be
    wished that Mr. Baillie, or some other equally accomplished
    laborer in that field, would set himself to do for the "Futawa
    Alumgeeree" what Heineccius and other modern civilians have
    done for the law-books of Justinian&mdash;present the European
    public with an elegant and exact abstract of its contents.</p>

    <h2>THE MYSTERIOUS COMPACT.</h2>

    <h3>A FREE TRANSLATION FROM THE GERMAN.</h3>

    <h4>PART II&mdash;CONCLUSION</h4>

    <h4>(Concluded from page 192.)</h4>

    <p>Several weeks passed away. Edward spared no pains to
    discover some trace of the lady in question, but all in vain.
    No one in the neighborhood knew the family; and he had already
    determined, as soon as the spring began, to ask for leave of
    absence, and to travel through the country where Ferdinand had
    formed his unfortunate attachment, when a circumstance occurred
    which coincided strangely with his wishes. His
    commanding-officer gave him a commission to purchase some
    horses, which, to his great consolation, led him exactly into
    that part of the country where Ferdinand had been quartered. It
    was a market-town of some importance. He was to remain there
    some time, which suited his plans exactly; and he made use of
    every leisure hour to cultivate the acquaintance of the
    officers, to inquire into Ferdinand's connections and
    acquaintance, to trace the mysterious name if possible, and
    thus fulfill a sacred duty. For to him it appeared a sacred
    duty to execute the commission of his departed friend&mdash;to
    get possession of the ring, and to be the means, as he hoped,
    of giving rest to the troubled spirit of Ferdinand.</p>

    <p>Already, on the evening of the second day, he was sitting in
    the coffee-room with burghers of the place and officers of
    different regiments.</p>

    <p>A newly-arrived cornet was inquiring whether the
    neighborhood were a pleasant one, of an infantry officer, one
    of Hallberg's corps. "For," said he, "I come from charming
    quarters."</p>

    <p>"There is not much to boast of," replied the captain. "There
    is no good fellowship, no harmony among the people."</p>

    <p>"I will tell you why that is," cried an animated lieutenant;
    "that is because there is no house as a point of reunion, where
    one is sure to find and make acquaintances, and to be amused,
    and where each individual ascertains his own merits by the
    effect they produce on society at large."</p>

    <p>"Yes, we have had nothing of that kind since the Varniers
    left us," said the captain.</p>

    <p>"Varniers!" cried Edward, with an eagerness he could ill
    conceal. "The name sounds foreign."</p>

    <p>"They were not Germans&mdash;they were emigrants from the
    Netherlands, who had left their country on account of political
    troubles," replied the captain.</p>

    <p>"Ah, that was a charming house," cried the lieutenant,
    "cultivation, refinement, a sufficient competency, the whole
    style of establishment free from ostentation, yet most
    comfortable; and Emily&mdash;Emily was the soul of the whole
    house."</p>

    <p>"Emily Varnier!" echoed Edward, while his heart beat fast
    and loud.</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes! that was the name of the prettiest, most
    graceful, most amiable girl in the world," said the
    lieutenant.</p>

    <p>"You seem bewitched by the fair Emily," observed the
    cornet.</p>

    <p>"I think you would have been too, had you known her,"
    rejoined the lieutenant; "she was the jewel of the whole
    society. Since she went away there is no bearing their stupid
    balls and assemblies."</p>

    <p>"But you must not forget," the captain resumed once more,
    "when you attribute everything to the charms of the fair girl,
    that not only she but the whole family has disappeared, and we
    have lost that house which formed, as you say, so charming a
    point of reunion in our neighborhood."</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes; exactly so," said an old gentleman, a civilian,
    who had been silent hitherto; "the Varniers' house is a great
    loss in the country, where such losses are not so easily
    replaced as in a large town. First, the father died, then came
    the cousin and carried the daughter away."</p>

    <p>"And did this cousin marry the young lady?" inquired Edward,
    in a tone tremulous with agitation.</p>

    <p>"Certainly," answered the old gentleman; "it was a very
    great match for her; he bought land to the value of half a
    million about here."</p>

    <p>"And he was an agreeable, handsome man, we must all allow,"
    remarked the captain.</p>

    <p>"But she would never have married him," exclaimed the
    lieutenant, "if poor Hallberg had not died."</p>

    <p>Edward was breathless, but he did not speak a word.</p>

    <p>"She would have been compelled to do so in any case," said
    the old man; "the father had destined them for each other from
    infancy, and people say he made his daughter take a vow as he
    lay on his death-bed."</p>

    <p>"That sounds terrible," said Edward; "and does not speak
    much for the good feeling of the cousin."</p>

    <p>"She could not have fulfilled her father's wish," interposed
    the lieutenant; "her heart was bound up in Hallberg, and
    Hallberg's in her. Few people, perhaps, know this, for the
    lovers were prudent and discreet; I, however, knew it all."</p>

    <p>"And why was she not allowed to follow the inclination of
    her heart?" asked Edward.</p>

    <p>"Because her father had promised her," replied the captain:
    "you used just now the word terrible; it is a fitting
    expression, according to my version of the matter. It appears
    that one of the branches of the house of Varnier had committed
    an act of injustice toward another, and Emily's father
    considered it a point of conscience to make reparation. Only
    through the marriage of his daughter with a member of the
    ill-used branch could that act be obliterated and made up for,
    and, therefore, he pressed the matter sorely."</p>

    <p>"Yes, and the headlong passion which Emily inspired her
    cousin with abetted his
    designs."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page279"
       id="page279"></a>[pg 279]</span>

    <p>"Then her cousin loved Emily?" inquired Edward.</p>

    <p>"Oh, to desperation," was the reply. "He was a rival to her
    shadow, who followed her not more closely than he did. He was
    jealous of the rose that she placed on her bosom."</p>

    <p>"Then poor Emily is not likely to have a calm life with such
    a man," said Edward.</p>

    <p>"Come," interposed the old gentleman, with en authoritative
    tone, "I think you, gentlemen, go a little too far. I know
    D'Effernay; he is an honest, talented man, very rich, indeed,
    and generous; he anticipates his wife in every wish. She has
    the most brilliant house in the neighborhood, and lives like a
    princess."</p>

    <p>"And trembles," insisted the lieutenant, "when she hears her
    husband's footstep. What good can riches be to her? She would
    have been happier with Hallberg."</p>

    <p>"I do not know," rejoined the captain, "why you always
    looked upon that attachment as something so decided. It never
    appeared so to me; and you yourself say that D'Effernay is very
    jealous, which I believe him to be, for he is a man of strong
    passions; and this very circumstance causes me to doubt the
    rest of your story. Jealousy has sharp eyes, and D'Effernay
    would have discovered a rival in Hallberg, and not proved
    himself the friend he always was to our poor comrade."</p>

    <p>"That does not follow at all," replied the lieutenant, "it
    only proves that the lovers were very cautious. So far,
    however, I agree with you. I believe that if D'Effernay had
    suspected anything of the kind he would have murdered
    Hallberg."</p>

    <p>A shudder passed through Edward's veins.</p>

    <p>"Murdered!" he repeated, in a hollow voice; "do you not
    judge too harshly of this man when you hint the possibility of
    such a thing?"</p>

    <p>"That does he, indeed," said the old man; "these gentlemen
    are all angry with D'Effernay, because he has carried off the
    prettiest girl in the country. But I am told he does not intend
    remaining where he now lives. He wishes to sell his
    estates."</p>

    <p>"Really," inquired the captain, "and where is he going?"</p>

    <p>"I have no idea," replied the other; "but he is selling
    everything off. One manor is already disposed of, and there
    have been people already in negotiation for the place where he
    resides."</p>

    <p>The conversation now turned on the value of D'Effernay's
    property, and of land in general, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>Edward had gained materials enough for reflection; he rose
    soon, took leave of the company, and gave himself up, in the
    solitude of his own room, to the torrent of thought and feeling
    which that night's conversation had let loose. So, then, it was
    true; Emily Varnier was no fabulous being! Hallberg had loved
    her, his love had been returned, but a cruel destiny had
    separated them. How wonderfully did all he had heard explain
    the dream at the Castle, and how completely did that supply
    what had remained doubtful, or had been omitted in the
    officers' narrative. Emily Varnier, doubtless, possessed that
    ring, to gain possession of which now seemed his bounden duty.
    He resolved not to delay its fulfillment a moment, however
    difficult it might prove, and he only reflected on the best
    manner in which he should perform the task allotted to him. The
    sale of the property appeared to him a favorable opening. The
    fame of his father's wealth made it probable that the son might
    wish to be purchaser of a fine estate, like the one in
    question. He spoke openly of such a project, made inquiries of
    the old gentleman, and the captain, who seemed to him to know
    most about the matter; and as his duties permitted a trip for a
    week or so, he started immediately, and arrived on the second
    day at the place of his destination. He stopped in the public
    house in the village to inquire if the estate lay near, and
    whether visitors were allowed to see the house and grounds.
    Mine host, who doubtless had had his directions, sent a
    messenger immediately to the Castle, who returned before long,
    accompanied by a chasseur, in a splendid livery, who invited
    the stranger to the Castle in the name of M. D'Effernay.</p>

    <p>This was exactly what Edward wished, and expected. Escorted
    by the chasseur he soon arrived at the Castle, and was shown up
    a spacious staircase into a modern, almost, one might say, a
    magnificently-furnished room, where the master of the house
    received him. It was evening, toward the end of winter, the
    shades of twilight had already fallen, and Edward found himself
    suddenly in a room quite illuminated with wax candles.
    D'Effernay stood in the middle of the saloon, a tall, thin
    young man. A proud bearing seemed to bespeak a consciousness of
    his own merit, or at least of his position. His features were
    finely formed, but the traces of strong passion, or of internal
    discontent, had lined them prematurely.</p>

    <p>In figure he was very slender, and the deep-sunken eye, the
    gloomy frown which was fixed between his brows, and the thin
    lips, had no very prepossessing expression, and yet there was
    something imposing in the whole appearance of the man.</p>

    <p>Edward thanked him civilly for his invitation, spoke of his
    idea of being a purchaser as a motive for his visit, and gave
    his own, and his father's name. D'Effernay seemed pleased with
    all he said. He had known Edward's family in the metropolis; he
    regretted that the late hour would render it impossible for
    them to visit the property to-day, and concluded by pressing
    the lieutenant to pass the night at the Castle. On the morrow
    they would proceed to business, and now he would have the
    pleasure of presenting his wife to the visitor. Edward's heart
    beat violently&mdash;at length then he would see her! Had he
    loved <span class="pagenum"><a name="page280"
       id="page280"></a>[pg 280]</span> her himself he could not
       have gone to meet her with more agitation. D'Effernay led
       his guest through many rooms, which were all as well
       furnished, and as brilliantly lighted as the first he had
       entered. At length he opened the door of a small boudoir,
       where there was no light, save that which the faint, gray
       twilight imparted through the windows.</p>

    <p>The simple arrangement of this little room, with dark green
    walls, only relieved by some engravings and coats of arms,
    formed a pleasing contrast to Edward's eyes, after the glaring
    splendor of the other apartments. From behind a piano-forte, at
    which she had been seated in a recess, rose a tall, slender
    female form, in a white dress of extreme simplicity.</p>

    <p>"My love," said D'Effernay, "I bring you a welcome guest,
    Lieutenant Wensleben, who is willing to purchase the
    estate."</p>

    <p>Emily courtesied; the friendly twilight concealed the
    shudder that passed over her whole frame, as she heard the
    familiar name which aroused so many recollections.</p>

    <p>She bade the stranger welcome, in a low, sweet voice, whose
    tremulous accents were not unobserved by Edward; and while the
    husband made some further observation, he had leisure to
    remark, as well as the fading light would allow, the fair
    outline of her oval face, the modest grace of her movements,
    her pretty, nymph-like figure&mdash;in fact, all those charms
    which seemed familiar to him through the impassioned
    descriptions of his friend.</p>

    <p>"But what can this fancy be, to sit in the dark?" asked
    D'Effernay, in no mild tone; "you know that is a thing I cannot
    bear." and with these words, and without waiting his wife's
    answer, he rang the bell over her sofa, and ordered lights.</p>

    <p>While these were placed on the table the company sat down by
    the fire, and conversation commenced. By the full light Edward
    could perceive all Emily's real beauty&mdash;her pale, but
    lovely face, the sad expression of her large blue eyes, so
    often concealed by their dark lashes, and then raised, with a
    look full of feeling, a sad, pensive, intellectual expression;
    and he admired the simplicity of her dress, and of every object
    that surrounded her: all appeared to him to bespeak a superior
    mind.</p>

    <p>They had not sat long, before D'Effernay was called away.
    One of his people had something important, something urgent to
    communicate to him, which admitted of no delay. A look of
    fierce anger almost distorted his features; in an instant his
    thin lips moved rapidly, and Edward thought he muttered some
    curses between his teeth. He left the room, but in so doing, he
    cast a glance of mistrust and ill-temper on the handsome
    stranger with whom he was compelled to leave his wife alone.
    Edward observed it all. All that he had seen to-day, all that
    he had heard from his comrades of the man's passionate and
    suspicious disposition, convinced him that his stay here would
    not be long, and that perhaps a second opportunity of speaking
    alone with Emily might not offer itself.</p>

    <p>He determined, therefore, to profit by the present moment;
    and no sooner had D'Effernay left the room, than he began to
    tell Emily she was not so complete a stranger to him as it
    might seem; that long before he had had the pleasure of seeing
    her&mdash;even before he had heard her name&mdash;she was known
    to him, so to speak, in spirit.</p>

    <p>Madame D'Effernay was moved. She was silent for a time, and
    gazed fixedly on the ground; then she looked up; the mist of
    unshed tears dimmed her blue eyes, and her bosom heaved with
    the sigh she could not suppress.</p>

    <p>"To me also the name of Wensleben is familiar. There is a
    link between our souls. Your friend has often spoken of you to
    me."</p>

    <p>But she could say no more; tears checked her speech.</p>

    <p>Edward's eyes were glistening also, and the two companions
    were silent; at length he began once more:</p>

    <p>"My dear lady," he said, "my time is short, and I have a
    solemn message to deliver to you. Will you allow me to do so
    now?"</p>

    <p>"To me?" she asked, in a tone of astonishment.</p>

    <p>"From my departed friend," answered Edward,
    emphatically.</p>

    <p>"From Ferdinand?&mdash;and that now&mdash;after&mdash;" she
    shrunk back, as if in terror.</p>

    <p>"Now that he is no longer with us, do you mean? I found the
    message in his papers, which have been intrusted to me only
    lately, since I have been in the neighborhood. Among them was a
    token which I was to restore to you." He produced the ring.
    Emily seized it wildly, and trembled as she looked upon it.</p>

    <p>"It is indeed my ring," she said at length, "the same which
    I gave him when we plighted our troth in secret. You are
    acquainted with everything, I perceive; I shall therefore risk
    nothing if I speak openly."</p>

    <p>She wept, and pressed the ring to her lips.</p>

    <p>"I see that my friend's memory is dear to you," continued
    Edward. You will forgive the prayer I am about to make to you:
    my visit to you concerns his ring."</p>

    <p>"How&mdash;what is it you wish?" cried Emily; terrified.</p>

    <p>"It was <i>his</i> wish," replied Edward. "He evinced an
    earnest desire to have this pledge of an unfortunate and
    unfulfilled engagement restored."</p>

    <p>"How is that possible? You did not speak with him before his
    death; and this happened so suddenly after, that, to give you
    the commission&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"There was no time for it! that is true," answered Edward,
    with an inward shudder, although outwardly he was calm.
    "Perhaps this wish was awakened immediately before his death. I
    found it, as I told you, expressed in those
    papers."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"
       id="page281"></a>[pg 281]</span>

    <p>"Incomprehensible!" she exclaimed. "Only a short time before
    his death, we cherished&mdash;deceitful, indeed, they proved,
    but, oh, what blessed hopes! we reckoned on casualties, on what
    might possibly occur to assist as. Neither of us could endure
    to dwell on the idea of separation; and yet&mdash;yet
    since&mdash;Oh, my God," she cried, overcome by sorrow, and she
    hid her face between her hands.</p>

    <p>Edward was lost in confused thought. For a time both again
    were silent: at length Emily started up&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Forgive me, M. de Wensleben. What you have related to me,
    what you have asked of me, has produced so much excitement, so
    much agitation, that it is necessary that I should be alone for
    a few moments, to recover my composure."</p>

    <p>"I am gone," cried Edward, springing from his chair.</p>

    <p>"No! no!" she replied, "you are my guest; remain here. I
    have a household duty which calls me away." She laid a stress
    on these words.</p>

    <p>She leant forward, and with a sad, sweet smile, she gave her
    hand to the friend of her lost Ferdinand, pressing his gently,
    and disappeared through the inner door.</p>

    <p>Edward stood stunned, bewildered; then he paced the room
    with hasty steps, threw himself on the sofa, and took up one of
    the books that lay on the table, rather to have something in
    his hand, than to read. It proved to be Young's "Night
    Thoughts." He looked through it, and was attracted by many
    passages, which seemed, in his present frame of mind, fraught
    with peculiar meaning; yet his thoughts wandered constantly
    from the page to his dead friend. The candles, unheeded both by
    Emily and him, burned on with long wicks, giving little light
    in the silent room, over which the red glare from the hearth
    shed a lurid glow. Hurried footsteps sounded in the anteroom;
    the door was thrown open.</p>

    <p>Edward looked up, and saw D'Effernay staring at him, and
    round the room, in an angry, restless manner.</p>

    <p>Edward could not but think there was something almost
    unearthly in those dark looks and that towering form.</p>

    <p>"Where is my wife?" was D'Effernay's first question.</p>

    <p>"She is gone to fulfill some household duty," replied the
    other.</p>

    <p>"And leaves you here alone in this miserable darkness! Most
    extraordinary!&mdash;indeed, most unaccountable!" and as he
    spoke he approached the table and snuffed the candles, with a
    movement of impatience.</p>

    <p>"She left me here with old friends," said Edward, with a
    forced smile. "I have been reading."</p>

    <p>"What, in the dark?" inquired D'Effernay, with a look of
    mistrust. "It was so dark when I came in, that you could not
    possibly have distinguished a letter."</p>

    <p>"I read for some time, and then I fell into a train of
    thought, which is usually the result of reading Young's 'Night
    Thoughts.'"</p>

    <p>"Young! I cannot bear that author. He is so gloomy."</p>

    <p>"But you are fortunately so happy, that the lamentations of
    the lonely mourner can find no echo in your breast."</p>

    <p>"You think so!" said D'Effernay, in a churlish tone, and he
    pressed his lips together tightly, as Emily came into the room:
    he went to meet her.</p>

    <p>"You have been a long time away," was his observation, as he
    looked into her eyes, where the trace of tears might easily be
    detected. "I found our guest alone."</p>

    <p>"M. de Wensleben was good enough to excuse me," she replied;
    "and then I thought you would be back immediately."</p>

    <p>They sat down to the table; coffee was brought, and the past
    appeared to be forgotten.</p>

    <p>The conversation at first was broken by constant pauses.
    Edward saw that Emily did all she could to play the hostess
    agreeably, and to pacify her husband's ill-humor.</p>

    <p>In this attempt the young man assisted her, and at last they
    were successful. D'Effernay became more cheerful; the
    conversation more animated; and Edward found that his host
    could be a very agreeable member of society when he pleased,
    combining a good deal of information with great natural powers.
    The evening passed away more pleasantly than it promised at one
    time; and after an excellent and well-served supper, the young
    officer was shown into a comfortable room, fitted up with every
    modern luxury; and weary in mind and body, he soon fell asleep.
    He dreamed of all that had occupied his waking thoughts-of his
    friend, and his friend's history.</p>

    <p>But in that species of confusion which often characterizes
    dreams, he fancied that he was Ferdinand, or at least, his own
    individuality seemed mixed up with that of Hallberg. He felt
    that he was ill. He lay in an unknown room, and by his bedside
    stood a small table, covered with glasses and phials,
    containing medicines, as is usual in a sick room.</p>

    <p>The door opened, and D'Effernay came in, in his
    dressing-gown, as if he had just left his bed: and now in
    Edward's mind dreams and realities were mingled together, and
    he thought that D'Effernay came, perhaps, to speak with him on
    the occurrences of the preceding day. But no! he approached the
    table on which the medicines stood, looked at the watch, took
    up one of the phials and a cup, measured the draught, drop by
    drop, then he turned and looked round him stealthily, and then
    he drew from his breast a pale blue, coiling serpent, which he
    threw into the cup, and held it to the patient's lips, who
    drank, and instantly felt a numbness creep over his frame which
    ended in death. Edward fancied that he was dead; he saw the
    coffin brought, but the terror lest he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page282"
       id="page282"></a>[pg 282]</span> should be buried alive,
       made him start up with a sudden effort, and he opened his
       eyes.</p>

    <p>The dream had passed away; he sat in his bed safe and well;
    but it was long ere he could in any degree recover his
    composure, or get rid of the impression which the frightful
    apparition had made on him. They brought his breakfast, with a
    message from the master of the house to inquire whether he
    would like to visit the park, farms, &amp;c. He dressed
    quickly, and descended to the court, where he found his host in
    a riding dress, by the side of two fine horses, already
    saddled. D'Effernay greeted the young man courteously; but
    Edward felt an inward repugnance as he looked on that gloomy
    though handsome countenance, now lighted up by the beams of the
    morning sun, yet recalling vividly the dark visions of the
    night. D'Effernay was full of attentions to his new friend.
    They started on their ride, in spite of some threatening
    clouds, and began the inspection of meadows, shrubberies,
    farms, &amp;c. After a couple of hours, which were consumed in
    this manner, it began to rain a few drops, and at last burst
    out into a heavy shower. It was soon impossible even to ride
    through the woods for the torrents that were pouring down, and
    so they returned to the castle.</p>

    <p>Edward retired to his room to change his dress, and to write
    some letters, he said, but more particularly to avoid Emily, in
    order not to excite her husband's jealousy. As the bell rang
    for dinner he saw her again, and found to his surprise that the
    captain, whom he had first seen in the coffee-room, and who had
    given him so much information, was one of the party. He was
    much pleased, for they had taken a mutual fancy to each other.
    The captain was not at quarters the day Edward had left them,
    but as soon as he heard where his friend had gone, he put
    horses to his carriage and followed him, for he said he also
    should like to see these famous estates. D'Effernay seemed in
    high good humor to-day, Emily far more silent than yesterday,
    and taking little part in the conversation of the men, which
    turned on political economy. After coffee she found an
    opportunity to give Edward (unobserved) a little packet. The
    look with which she did so, told plainly what it contained, and
    the young man hurried to his room as soon as he fancied he
    could do so without remark or comment. The continued rain
    precluded all idea of leaving the house any more that day. He
    unfolded the packet; there were a couple of sheets, written
    closely in a woman's fair hand, and something wrapped carefully
    in a paper, which he knew to be the ring. It was the fellow to
    that which he had given the day before to Emily, only
    Ferdinand's name was engraved inside instead of hers. Such were
    the contents of the papers:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Secrecy would be misplaced with the friend of the dead.
    Therefore, will I speak to you of things which I have never
    uttered to a human being until now. Jules D'Effernay is nearly
    related to me. We knew each other in the Netherlands, where our
    estates joined. The boy loved me already with a love that
    amounted to passion; this love was my father's greatest joy,
    for there was an old and crying injustice which the ancestors
    of D'Effernay had suffered from ours, that could alone, he
    thought, be made up by the marriage of the only children of the
    two branches. So we were destined for each other almost from
    our cradles; and I was content it should be so, for Jules's
    handsome face and decided preference for me were agreeable to
    me, although I felt no great affection for him. We were
    separated: Jules traveled in France, England, and America, and
    made money as a merchant, which profession he had taken up
    suddenly. My father, who had a place under government, left his
    country in consequence of political troubles, and came into
    this part of the world where some distant relations of my
    mother's lived. He liked the neighborhood; he bought land; we
    lived very happily; I was quite contented in Jules's absence; I
    had no yearning of the heart toward him, yet I thought kindly
    of him, and troubled myself little about my future.
    Then&mdash;then I learned to know your friend. Oh, then! I
    felt, when I looked upon him, when I listened to him, when we
    conversed together, I felt, I acknowledged that there might be
    happiness on earth, of which I had hitherto never dreamed. Then
    I loved for the first time, ardently, passionately, and was
    beloved in return. Acquainted with the family engagements, he
    did not dare openly to proclaim his love, and I knew I ought
    not to foster the feeling; but, alas! how seldom does passion
    listen to the voice of reason and of duty. Your friend and I
    met in secret; in secret we plighted our troth, and exchanged
    those rings, and hoped and believed that by showing a bold
    front to our destiny we should subdue it to our will. The
    commencement was sinful, it has met with a dire retribution,
    Jules's letters announced his speedy return. He had sold
    everything in his own country, had given up all his mercantile
    affairs, through which he had greatly increased an already
    considerable fortune, and now he was about to join us, or
    rather me, without whom he could not live. This appeared to me
    like the demand for payment of a heavy debt. This debt I owed
    to Jules, who loved me with all his heart, who was in
    possession of my father's promised word and mine also. Yet I
    could not give up your friend. In a state of distraction I told
    him all; we meditated flight. Yes, I was so far guilty, and I
    make the confession in hopes that some portion of my errors may
    be expiated by repentance. My father, who had long been in a
    declining state, suddenly grew worse, and this delayed and
    hindered the fulfillment of our designs. Jules arrived. During
    the five years he had been away he was much changed in
    appearance, and that advantageously. I was struck
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page283"
       id="page283"></a>[pg 283]</span> when I first saw him, but
       it was also easy to detect in those handsome features and
       manly bearing, a spirit of restlessness and violence which
       had already shown itself in him as a boy, and which passing
       years, with their bitter experience and strong passions, had
       greatly developed. The hope that we had cherished of
       D'Effernay's possible indifference to me, of the change
       which time might have wrought in his attachment, now seemed
       idle and absurd. His love was indeed impassioned. He
       embraced me in a manner that made me shrink from him, and
       altogether his deportment toward me was a strange contrast
       to the gentle, tender, refined affection of our dear friend.
       I trembled whenever Jules entered the room, and all that I
       had prepared to say to him, all the plans which I had
       revolved in my mind respecting him, vanished in an instant
       before the power of his presence, and the almost imperative
       manner in which he claimed my hand. My father's illness
       increased; he was now in a very precarious state, hopeless
       indeed. Jules rivaled me in filial attentions to him, that I
       can never cease to thank him for; but this illness made my
       situation more and more critical, and it accelerated the
       fulfillment of the contract. I was now to renew my promise
       to him by the death-bed of my father. Alas, alas! I fell
       senseless to the ground when this announcement was made to
       me. Jules began to suspect. Already my cold, embarrassed
       manner toward him since his return had struck him as
       strange. He began to suspect, I repeat, and the effect that
       this suspicion had on him, it would be impossible to
       describe to you. Even now, after so long a time, now that I
       am accustomed to his ways, and more reconciled to my fate by
       the side of a noble, though somewhat impetuous man, it makes
       me tremble to think of those paroxysms, which the idea that
       I did not love him called forth. They were fearful; he
       nearly sank under them. During two days his life was in
       danger. At last the storm passed, my father died; Jules
       watched over me with the tenderness of a brother, the
       solicitude of a parent; for that indeed I shall ever be
       grateful. His suspicion once awakened, he gazed round with
       penetrating looks to discover the cause of my altered
       feelings. But your friend never came to our house; we met in
       an unfrequented spot, and my father's illness had
       interrupted these interviews. Altogether I cannot tell if
       Jules discovered anything. A fearful circumstance rendered
       all our precautions useless, and cut the knot of our secret
       connection, to loose which voluntarily I felt I had no
       power. A wedding feast, at a neighboring castle, assembled
       all the nobility and gentry, and officers quartered near,
       together; my deep mourning was an excuse for my absence.
       Jules, though he usually was happiest by my side, could not
       resist the invitation, and your friend resolved to go,
       although he was unwell; he feared to raise suspicion by
       remaining away, when I was left at home. With great
       difficulty he contrived the first day to make one at a
       splendid hunt, the second day he could not leave his bed. A
       physician, who was in the house, pronounced his complaint to
       be violent fever, and Jules, whose room joined that of the
       sick man, offered him every little service and kindness
       which compassion and good feeling prompted; and I cannot but
       praise him all the more for it, as who can tell, perhaps,
       his suspicion might have taken the right direction? On the
       morning of the second day&mdash;but let me glance quickly at
       that terrible time, the memory of which can never pass from
       my mind&mdash;a fit of apoplexy most unexpectedly, but
       gently, ended the noblest life, and separated us forever!
       Now you know all. I inclose the ring. I cannot write more.
       Farewell!"</p>

    <p>The conclusion of the letter made a deep impression on
    Edward. His dream rose up before his remembrance, the slight
    indisposition, the sudden death, the fearful nursetender, all
    arranged themselves in order before his mind, and an awful
    whole rose out of all these reflections, a terrible suspicion
    which he tried to throw off. But he could not do so, and when
    he met the captain and D'Effernay in the evening, and the
    latter challenged his visitors to a game of billiards, Edward
    glanced from time to time at his host in a scrutinizing manner,
    and could not but feel that the restless discontent which was
    visible in his countenance, and the unsteady glare of his eyes,
    which shunned the fixed look of others, only fitted too well
    into the shape of the dark thoughts which were crossing his own
    mind. Late in the evening, after supper, they played whist in
    Emily's boudoir. On the morrow, if the weather permitted, they
    were to conclude their inspection of the surrounding property,
    and the next day they were to visit the iron foundries, which,
    although distant from the Castle several miles, formed a very
    important item in the rent-roll of the estates. The company
    separated for the night. Edward fell asleep; and the same
    dream, with the same circumstances, recurred, only with the
    full consciousness that the sick man was Ferdinand. Edward felt
    overpowered, a species of horror took possession of his mind,
    as he found himself now in regular communication with the
    beings of the invisible world.</p>

    <p>The weather favored D'Effernay's projects. The whole day was
    passed in the open air. Emily only appeared at meals, and in
    the evening when they played at cards. Both she and Edward
    avoided, as if by mutual consent, every word, every look that
    could awaken the slightest suspicion or jealous feeling in
    D'Effernay's mind. She thanked him in her heart for this
    forbearance, but her thoughts were in another world; she took
    little heed of what passed around her. Her husband was in an
    excellent temper; he played the part of host to perfection; and
    when the two officers were established comfortably by the fire,
    in the captain's room, smoking together, they could not but do
    justice to his courteous
    manners.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284"
       id="page284"></a>[pg 284]</span>

    <p>"He appears to be a man of general information," remarked
    Edward.</p>

    <p>"He has traveled a great deal, and read a great deal, as I
    told you when we first met: he is a remarkable man, but one of
    uncontrolled passions, and desperately jealous."</p>

    <p>"Yet he appears very attentive to his wife."</p>

    <p>"Undoubtedly he is wildly in love with her; yet he makes her
    unhappy, and himself too."</p>

    <p>"He certainly does not appear happy, there is so much
    restlessness."</p>

    <p>"He can never bear to remain in one place for any length of
    time together. He is now going to sell the property he only
    bought last year. There is an instability about him; everything
    palls on him."</p>

    <p>"That is the complaint of many who are rich and well to do
    in the world."</p>

    <p>"Yes; only not in the same degree. I assure you it has often
    struck me that man must have a bad conscience."</p>

    <p>"What an idea!" rejoined Edward, with a forced laugh, for
    the captain's remark struck him forcibly. "He seems a man of
    honor."</p>

    <p>"Oh, one may be a man of honor, as it is called, and yet
    have something quite bad enough to reproach yourself with. But
    I know nothing about it, and would not breathe such a thing
    except to you. His wife, too, looks so pale and so
    oppressed."</p>

    <p>"But, perhaps, that is her natural complexion and
    expression."</p>

    <p>"Oh, no! no! the year before D'Effernay came from Paris, she
    was as fresh as a rose. Many people declare that your poor
    friend loved her. The affair was wrapped in mystery, and I
    never believed the report, for Hallberg was a steady man, and
    the whole country knew that Emily had been engaged a long
    time."</p>

    <p>"Hallberg never mentioned the name in his letters," answered
    Edward, with less candor than usual.</p>

    <p>"I thought not. Besides D'Effernay was very much attached to
    him, and mourned his death."</p>

    <p>"Indeed!"</p>

    <p>"I assure you the morning that Hallberg was found dead in
    his bed so unexpectedly, D'Effernay was like one beside
    himself."</p>

    <p>"Very extraordinary. But as we are on the subject, tell me,
    I pray you, all the circumstances of my poor Ferdinand's
    illness, and awful sudden death."</p>

    <p>"I can tell you all about it, as well as any one, for I was
    one of the guests at that melancholy wedding. Your friend, and
    I, and many others were invited. Hallberg had some idea of not
    going; he was unwell, with violent headache and giddiness. But
    we persuaded him, and he consented to go with us. The first day
    he felt tolerably well. We hunted in the open field; we were
    all on horseback, the day hot. Hallberg felt worse. The second
    day he had a great deal of fever; he could not stay up. The
    physician (for fortunately there was one in the company)
    ordered rest, cooling medicine, neither of which seemed to do
    him good. The rest of the men dispersed, to amuse themselves in
    various ways. Only D'Effernay remained at home; he was never
    very fond of large societies, and we voted that he was
    discontented and out of humor because his betrothed bride was
    not with him. His room was next to the sick man's, to whom he
    gave all possible care and attention, for poor Hallberg,
    besides being ill, was in despair at giving so much trouble in
    a strange house. D'Effernay tried to calm him on this point; he
    nursed him, amused him with conversation, mixed his medicines,
    and, in fact, showed more kindness and tenderness, than any of
    us would have given him credit for. Before I went to bed I
    visited Hallberg, and found him much better, and more cheerful;
    the doctor had promised that he should leave his bed next day.
    So I left him and retired with the rest of the world, rather
    late, and very tired, to rest. The next morning I was awoke by
    the fatal tidings. I did not wait to dress, I ran to his room,
    it was full of people."</p>

    <p>"And how, how was the death first discovered?" inquired
    Edward, in breathless eagerness.</p>

    <p>"The servant, who came in to attend on him, thought he was
    asleep, for he lay in his usual position, his head upon his
    hand. He went away and waited for some time; but hours passed,
    and he thought he ought to wake his master to give him his
    medicine. Then the awful discovery was made. He must have died
    peacefully, for his countenance was so calm, his limbs
    undisturbed. A fit of apoplexy had terminated his life, but in
    the most tranquil manner."</p>

    <p>"Incomprehensible," said Edward, with a deep sigh. "Did they
    take no measures to restore animation?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly; all that could be done was done, bleeding,
    fomentation, friction; the physician superintended, but there
    was no hope, it was all too late. He must have been dead some
    hours, for he was already cold and stiff. If there had been a
    spark of life in him he would have been saved. It was all over;
    I had lost my good lieutenant, and the regiment one of its
    finest officers."</p>

    <p>He was silent, and appeared lost in thought. Edward, for his
    part, felt overwhelmed by terrible suspicions and sad memories.
    After a long pause he recovered himself: "and where was
    D'Effernay?" he inquired.</p>

    <p>"D'Effernay," answered the Captain, rather surprised at the
    question; "oh! he was not in the Castle when we made the
    dreadful discovery: he had gone out for an early walk, and when
    he came back late, not before noon, he learned the truth, and
    was like one out of his senses. It seemed so awful to him,
    because he had been so much, the very day before, with poor
    Hallberg."</p>

    <p>"Aye," answered Edward, whose suspicions were being more and
    more confirmed every moment. "And did he see the corpse, did he
    go into the chamber of death?"</p>

    <p>"No," replied the captain; "he assured us
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page285"
       id="page285"></a>[pg 285]</span> it was out of his power to
       do so; he could not bear the sight; and I believe it. People
       with such uncontrolled feelings as this D'Effernay, are
       incapable of performing those duties which others think it
       necessary and incumbent on them to fulfill."</p>

    <p>"And where was Hallberg buried?"</p>

    <p>"Not far from the castle where the mournful event took
    place. To-morrow, if we go to the iron foundry, we shall be
    near the spot."</p>

    <p>"I am glad of it," cried Edward eagerly, while a host of
    projects rose up in his mind. "But now, captain, I will not
    trespass any longer on your kindness. It is late, and we must
    be up betimes to-morrow. How far have we to go?"</p>

    <p>"Not less than four leagues certainly. D'Effernay has
    arranged that we shall drive there, and see it all at our
    leisure: then we shall return in the evening. Good night,
    Wensleben."</p>

    <p>They separated: Edward hurried to his room; his heart
    overflowed. Sorrow on the one hand, horror and even hatred on
    the other, agitated him by turns. It was long before he could
    sleep. For the third time the vision haunted him; but now it
    was clearer than before; now he saw plainly the features of him
    who lay in bed, and of him who stood beside the bed&mdash;they
    were those of Hallberg and of D'Effernay.</p>

    <p>This third apparition, the exact counterpart of the two
    former (only more vivid), all that he had gathered from
    conversations on the subject, and the contents of Emily's
    letter, left scarcely the shadow of a doubt remaining as to how
    his friend had left the world.</p>

    <p>D'Effernay's jealous and passionate nature seemed to allow
    of the possibility of such a crime, and it could scarcely be
    wondered at, if Edward regarded him with a feeling akin to
    hatred. Indeed the desire of visiting Hallberg's grave, in
    order to place the ring in the coffin, could alone reconcile
    Wensleben to the idea of remaining any longer beneath the roof
    of a man whom he now considered the murderer of his friend. His
    mind was a prey to conflicting doubts; detestation for the
    culprit, and grief for the victim, pointed out one line of
    conduct, while the difficulty of proving D'Effernay's guilt,
    and still more, pity and consideration for Emily, determined
    him at length to let the matter rest, and to leave the
    murderer, if such he really were, to the retribution which his
    own conscience and the justice of God would award him. He would
    seek his friend's grave, and then he would separate from
    D'Effernay, and never see him more. In the midst of these
    reflections the servant came to tell him that the carriage was
    ready. A shudder passed over his frame as D'Effernay greeted
    him; but he commanded himself, and they started on their
    expedition.</p>

    <p>Edward spoke but little, and that only when it was
    necessary, and the conversation was kept up by his two
    companions; he had made every inquiry, before he set out,
    respecting the place of his friend's interment, the exact
    situation of the tomb, the name of the village, and its
    distance from the main road. On their way home, he requested
    that D'Effernay would give orders to the coachman to make a
    round of a mile or two as far as the village of &mdash;&mdash;,
    with whose rector he was particularly desirous to speak. A
    momentary cloud gathered on D'Effernay's brow, yet it seemed no
    more than his usual expression of vexation at any delay or
    hindrance; and he was so anxious to propitiate his rich
    visitor, who appeared likely to take the estate off his hands,
    that he complied with all possible courtesy. The coachman was
    directed to turn down a by-road, and a very bad one it was. The
    captain stood up in the carriage and pointed out the village to
    him, at some distance off; it lay in a deep ravine at the foot
    of the mountains.</p>

    <p>They arrived in the course of time, and inquired for the
    clergyman's house, which, as well as the church, was situated
    on rising ground. The three companions alighted from the
    carriage, which they left at the bottom of the hill, and walked
    up together in the direction of the rectory. Edward knocked at
    the door and was admitted, while the two others sat on a bench
    outside. He had promised to return speedily, but to
    D'Effernay's restless spirit, one-quarter of an hour appeared
    interminable.</p>

    <p>He turned to the captain and said, in a tone of impatience,
    "M. de Wensleben must have a great deal of business with the
    rector: we have been here an immense time, and he does not seem
    inclined to make his appearance.</p>

    <p>"Oh, I dare say he will come soon. The matter cannot detain
    him long."</p>

    <p>"What on earth can he have to do here?"</p>

    <p>"Perhaps you would call it a mere fancy&mdash;the enthusiasm
    of youth."</p>

    <p>"It has a name, I suppose?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly, but&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Is it sufficiently important, think you, to make us run the
    risk of being benighted on such roads as these?"</p>

    <p>"Why, it is quite early in the day."</p>

    <p>"But we have more than two leagues to go. Why will you not
    speak?&mdash;there cannot any great mystery."</p>

    <p>"Well, perhaps not a mystery, exactly, but just one of those
    subjects on which we are usually reserved with others."</p>

    <p>"So! so!" rejoined D'Effernay, with a little sneer. "Some
    love affair; some girl or another who pursues him, that he
    wants to get rid of."</p>

    <p>"Nothing of the kind, I can assure you," replied the captain
    drily. "It could scarcely be more innocent. He wishes, in fact,
    to visit his friend's grave."</p>

    <p>The listener's expression was one of scorn and anger. "It is
    worth the trouble certainly," he exclaimed, with a mocking
    laugh. "A charming sentimental pilgrimage, truly; and pray who
    is this beloved friend, over whose resting-place he must shed a
    tear and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page286"
       id="page286"></a>[pg 286]</span> plant a forget-me-not? He
       told me he had never been in the neighborhood before."</p>

    <p>"No more he had; neither did he know where poor Hallberg was
    buried until I told him."</p>

    <p>"Hallberg!" echoed the other in a tone that startled the
    captain, and caused him to turn and look fixedly in the
    speaker's face. It was deadly pale, and the captain observed
    the effort which D'Effernay made to recover his composure.</p>

    <p>"Hallberg!" he repeated again, in a calmer tone, "and was
    Wensleben a friend of his?"</p>

    <p>"His bosom friend from childhood. They were brought up
    together at the academy. Hallberg left it a year earlier than
    his friend."</p>

    <p>"Indeed!" said D'Effernay, scowling as he spoke, and working
    himself up into a passion. "And this lieutenant came here on
    this account, then, and the purchase of the estates was a mere
    excuse."</p>

    <p>"I beg your pardon," observed the captain, in a decided tone
    of voice; "I have already told you that it was I who informed
    him of the place where his friend lies buried."</p>

    <p>"That may be, but it was owing to his friendship, to the
    wish to learn something further of his fate, that we are
    indebted for the visit of this romantic knight-errant."</p>

    <p>"That does not appear likely," replied the captain, who
    thought it better to avert, if possible, the rising storm of
    his companion's fury. "Why should he seek for news of Hallberg
    here, when he comes from the place where he was quartered for a
    long time, and where all his comrades now are."</p>

    <p>"Well, I don't know," cried D'Effernay, whose passion was
    increasing every moment. "Perhaps you have heard what was once
    gossiped about the neighborhood, that Hallberg was an admirer
    of my wife before she married."</p>

    <p>"Oh yes, I have heard that report, but never believed it.
    Hallberg was a prudent, steady man, and every one knew that
    Mademoiselle Varnier's hand had been promised for some
    time."</p>

    <p>"Yes! yes! but you do not know to what lengths passion and
    avarice may lead: for Emily was rich. We must not forget that,
    when we discuss the matter; an elopement with the rich heiress
    would have been a fine thing for a poor, beggarly
    lieutenant."</p>

    <p>"Shame! shame! M. D'Effernay. How can you slander the
    character of that upright young man? If Hallberg were so
    unhappy as to love Mademoiselle Varnier&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"That he did! you may believe me so far, I had reason to
    know it, and I did know it."</p>

    <p>"We had better change the conversation altogether, as it has
    taken so unpleasant a turn, Hallberg is dead; his errors, be
    they what they may, lie buried with him. His name stands high
    with all who knew him Even you, M. D'Effernay&mdash;you were
    his friend."</p>

    <p>"I his friend? I hated him!&mdash;I loathed him!" D'Effernay
    could not proceed; he foamed at the mouth with rage.</p>

    <p>"Compose yourself!" said the Captain, rising as he spoke;
    "you look and speak like a madman."</p>

    <p>A madman! Who says I am mad? Now I see it all&mdash;the
    connection of the whole&mdash;the shameful conspiracy."</p>

    <p>"Your conduct is perfectly incomprehensible to me," answered
    the captain, with perfect coolness. "Did you not attend
    Hallberg in his last illness, and give him his medicines with
    your own hand?"</p>

    <p>"I!" stammered D'Effernay. "No! no! no!" he cried, while the
    captain's growing suspicions increased every moment, on account
    of the perturbation which his companion displayed. "I never
    gave his medicines; whoever says that is a liar."</p>

    <p>"I say it!" exclaimed the officer, in a loud tone, for his
    patience was exhausted. "I say it, because I know that it was
    so, and I will maintain that fact against any one at any time.
    If you choose to contradict the evidence of my senses, it is
    you who are a liar!"</p>

    <p>"Ha! you shall give me satisfaction for this insult. Depend
    upon it, I am not one to be trifled with, as you shall find.
    You shall retract your words."</p>

    <p>"Never! I am ready to defend every word I have uttered here
    on this spot, at this moment, if you please. You have your
    pistols in the carriage, you know."</p>

    <p>D'Effernay cast a look of hatred on the speaker, and then
    dashing down the little hill, to the surprise of the servants,
    he dragged the pistols from the sword-case, and was by the
    captain's side in a moment. But the loud voices of the
    disputants had attracted Edward to the spot, and there he stood
    on D'Effernay's return; and by his side a venerable old man,
    who carried a large bunch of keys in his hand.</p>

    <p>"In heaven's name, what has happened?" cried Wensleben.</p>

    <p>"What are you about to do?" interposed the rector, in a tone
    of authority, though his countenance was expressive of horror.
    "Are you going to commit murder on this sacred spot, close to
    the precincts of the church?"</p>

    <p>"Murder! who speaks of murder?" cried D'Effernay. "Who can
    prove it?" and as he spoke, the captain turned a fierce,
    penetrating look upon him, beneath which he quailed.</p>

    <p>"But, I repeat the question," Edward began once more, "what
    does all this mean? I left you a short time ago in friendly
    conversation. I come back and find you both armed&mdash;both
    violently agitated&mdash;and M. D'Effernay, at least, speaking
    incoherently. What do you mean by 'proving it?'&mdash;to what
    do you allude?" At this moment, before any answer could be
    made, a man came out of the house with a pick-axe and shovel on
    his shoulder, and advancing toward the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page287"
       id="page287"></a>[pg 287]</span> rector, said respectfully,
       "I am quite ready, sir, if you have the key of the
       churchyard."</p>

    <p>It was now the captain's turn to look anxious: "What are you
    going to do, you surely don't intend&mdash;?" but as he spoke,
    the rector interrupted him.</p>

    <p>"This gentleman is very desirous to see the place where his
    friend lies buried."</p>

    <p>"But these preparations, what do they mean?"</p>

    <p>"I will tell you," said Edward, in a voice and tone that
    betrayed the deepest emotion, "I have a holy duty to perform. I
    must cause the coffin to be opened."</p>

    <p>"How, what!" screamed D'Effernay, once again. "Never&mdash;I
    will never permit such a thing."</p>

    <p>"But, sir," the old man spoke, in a tone of calm decision,
    contrasting wonderfully with the violence of him whom he
    addressed, "you have no possible right to interfere. If this
    gentleman wishes it, and I accede to the proposition, no one
    can prevent us from doing as we would."</p>

    <p>"I tell you I will not suffer it," continued D'Effernay,
    with the same frightful agitation. "Stir at your peril," he
    cried, turning sharply round upon the grave-digger, and holding
    a pistol to his head; but the captain pulled his arm away, to
    the relief of the frightened peasant.</p>

    <p>"M. D'Effernay," he said, "your conduct for the last
    half-hour has been most unaccountable&mdash;most
    unreasonable."</p>

    <p>"Come, come," interposed Edward, "Let us say no more on the
    subject; but let us be going," he addressed the rector; "we
    will not detain these gentlemen much longer."</p>

    <p>He made a step toward the churchyard, but D'Effernay
    clutched his arm, and, with an impious oath, "you shall not
    stir," he said; "that grave shall not be opened."</p>

    <p>Edward shook him off, with a look of silent hatred, for now
    indeed all his doubts were confirmed.</p>

    <p>D'Effernay saw that Wensleben was resolved, and a deadly
    pallor spread itself over his features, and a shudder passed
    visibly over his frame.</p>

    <p>"You are going!" he cried, with every gesture and appearance
    of insanity. "Go, then;" ... and he pointed the muzzle of the
    pistol to his mouth, and before any one could prevent him, he
    drew the trigger, and fell back a corpse. The spectators were
    motionless with surprise and horror; the captain was the first
    to recover himself in some degree. He bent over the body with
    the faint hope of detecting some sign of life. The old man
    turned pale and dizzy with a sense of terror, and he looked as
    if he would have swooned, had not Edward led him gently into
    his house, while the two others busied themselves with vain
    attempts to restore life.</p>

    <p>The spirit of D'Effernay had gone to its last account!</p>

    <p>It was, indeed, an awful moment. Death in its worst shape
    was before them, and a terrible duty still remained to be
    performed.</p>

    <p>Edward's cheek was blanched; his eye had a fixed look, yet
    he moved and spoke with a species of mechanical action, which
    had something almost ghastly in it. Causing the body to be
    removed into the house, he bade the captain summon the servants
    of the deceased, and then motioning with his hand to the
    awe-struck sexton, he proceeded with him to the churchyard. A
    few clods of earth alone were removed ere the captain stood by
    his friend's side.</p>

    <p>Here we must pause. Perhaps it were better altogether to
    emulate the silence that was maintained then and afterward by
    the two comrades. But the sexton could not be bribed to entire
    secrecy, and it was a story he loved to tell, with details we
    gladly omit, of how Wensleben solemnly performed his
    task&mdash;of how no doubt could any longer exist as to the
    cause of Hallberg's death. Those who love the horrible must
    draw on their own imaginations to supply what we resolutely
    withhold.</p>

    <p>Edward, we believe, never alluded to D'Effernay's death, and
    all the awful circumstances attending it, but twice&mdash;once,
    when, with every necessary detail, he and the captain gave
    their evidence to the legal authorities; and once, with as few
    details as possible, when he had an interview with the widow of
    the murderer, the beloved of the victim. The particulars of
    this interview he never divulged, for he considered Emily's
    grief too sacred to be exposed to the prying eyes of the
    curious and the unfeeling. She left the neighborhood
    immediately, leaving her worldly affairs in Wensleben's hands,
    who soon disposed of the property for her. She returned to her
    native country, with the resolution of spending the greater
    part of her wealth in relieving the distresses of others,
    wisely seeking, in the exercise of piety and benevolence, the
    only possible alleviation of her own deep and many-sided
    griefs. For Edward, he was soon pronounced to have recovered
    entirely from the shock of these terrible events. Of a
    courageous and energetic disposition, he pursued the duties of
    his profession with a firm step, and hid his mighty sorrow deep
    in the recesses of his heart. To the superficial observer,
    tears, groans, and lamentations are the only proofs of sorrow:
    and when they subside, the sorrow is said to have passed away
    also. Thus the captive, immured within the walls of his
    prison-house, is as one dead to the outward world, though the
    gaoler be a daily witness to the vitality of affliction.</p>

    <h2>PEASANT LIFE IN GERMANY.</h2>

    <p>We copy the following interesting paragraph from a work just
    issued in London on "The Social Condition and Education of the
    People of England and Europe," by Joseph Kay, of Cambridge
    University.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"As I have already said, the <i>moral, intellectual and
        physical condition of the peasants and operatives</i> of
        Prussia, Saxony and other parts of Germany, of Holland, and
        of the Protestant cantons of Switzerland, and the social
        condition of the peasants in the greater part of France,
        <i>is very much higher and happier, and very much more
        satisfactory, than that of the peasants and operatives of
        England</i>; the condition of the <i>poor</i> in the North
        German, Swiss and Dutch <i>towns</i>, is as remarkable a
        contrast to that of the poor of the <i>English towns</i> as
        can well be imagined; and that the condition of the
        <i>poorer classes</i> of Germany, Switzerland, Holland and
        France is <i>rapidly improving</i>. The great
        <i>superiority</i> of the <i>preparation</i> for life which
        a <i>poor man</i> receives in those countries I have
        mentioned, to that which a peasant or operative receives
        <i>in England</i>, and the difference of the social
        position of a poor man in those countries to that of a
        peasant or operative in England, seem sufficient to explain
        the difference which exists between the moral and social
        condition of the poor of our own country and of the other
        countries I have named. In Germany, Holland, and
        Switzerland, a child begins its life in the society of
        parents who have been educated and brought up for years in
        the company of learned and gentlemanly professors, and in
        the society and under the direction of a father who has
        been exercised in military arts, and who has acquired the
        bearing, the clean and orderly habits, and the taste for
        respectable attire, which characterize the soldier. The
        children of these countries spend the first six years of
        their lives in homes which are well regulated. They are
        during this time accustomed to orderly habits, to neat and
        clean clothes, and to ideas of the value of instruction, of
        the respect due to the teachers, and of the excellence of
        the schools, by parents who have, by their training in
        early life, acquired such tastes and ideas themselves. Each
        child at the age of six begins to attend a school, which is
        perfectly clean, well ventilated, directed by an able and
        well-educated gentleman, and superintended by the religious
        ministers and by the inspectors of the Government. Until
        the completion of its <i>fourteenth</i> year, each child
        continues regular daily attendance at one of these schools,
        daily strengthening its habits of cleanliness and order,
        learning the rudiments of useful knowledge, receiving the
        principles of religion and morality, and gaining confirmed
        health and physical energy by the exercise and drill of the
        school playground. <i>No children are left idle in the
        streets of the towns; no children are allowed to grovel in
        the gutters; no children are allowed to make</i> their
        appearance at the schools dirty, or in ragged clothes; and
        the local authorities are obliged to clothe all whose
        parents cannot afford to clothe them. The children of the
        <i>poor</i> of Germany, Holland and Switzerland acquire
        stronger habits of cleanliness, neatness and industry at
        the <i>primary</i> schools, than the children of the
        <i>small shopkeeping</i> classes of England do at the
        private schools of England; and they leave the <i>primary
        schools</i> of these countries <i>much better
        instructed</i> than those who leave our <i>middle class
        private schools</i>. After having learnt reading, writing,
        arithmetic, singing, geography, history and the Scriptures,
        the children leave the schools, carrying with them into
        life habits of cleanliness, neatness, order and industry,
        and awakened intellect, capable of collecting truths and
        reasoning upon them."</p>

    <h2>REMINISCENCES OF SARGENT S. PRENTISS, OF MISSISSIPPI.</h2>

    <h3>BY T.B. THORPE.</h3>

    <h4>AUTHOR OF "TOM OWEN, THE BEE HUNTER."</h4>

    <p>The death of Sargeant S. Prentiss has called forth an
    universal feeling of sorrow; the consciousness that "a great
    man has fallen" is depicted upon the faces of the
    multitude.</p>

    <p>The eloquent offerings to his virtues and to his genius that
    everywhere follow the news of his demise, are but slight tokens
    of that sorrow that fills the heart of all who knew the gifted
    Prentiss. Having known him long, and having had frequent
    occasions to witness exhibitions of his great mental powers, I
    cannot refrain from paying an imperfect tribute to his
    memory.</p>

    <p>I first met Mr. Prentiss when he was in the full maturity of
    his power, but I have the pleasure of knowing hundreds who were
    well acquainted with his early history and early triumphs.
    Volumes of interest might be written upon the life of Mr.
    Prentiss. And then his high sense of honor, his brave spirit,
    his nobleness of soul, his intense but commendable pride, his
    classical attainments, and his deep knowledge of the law, can
    scarcely be illustrated, so universal and superior were his
    accomplishments and acquirements.</p>

    <p>In his early career, I consider Mr. Prentiss both fortunate
    and unfortunate. I have often imagined the shrinking but proud
    boy, living unnoticed and unknown among the wealthiest citizens
    of the south. Buried in the obscurity of his humble school, he
    looked out upon the busy world, and measured the mighty
    capacities of his own soul with those whom society had placed
    above him. I think I see him brooding over his position, and
    longing to be free, as the suffocating man longs for the
    boundless air of heaven. His hour of triumph came, and
    surpassed, perhaps, his own aspirations. From the schoolroom he
    entered that of the court&mdash;a chance offered&mdash;a
    position gained&mdash;the law his theme, he at once not only
    equaled, but soared even beyond the aim of the most favored of
    his compeers.</p>

    <p>The era was one of extravagance. The virgin soil of
    Mississippi was pouring into the laps of her generous sons
    untold abundance. There were thousands of her citizens, full of
    health and talent, who adorned excesses of living by the
    tasteful procurements of wealth, and the highest
    accomplishments of mind. Into this world Prentiss entered,
    heralded by naught save his own genius. The heirs of princely
    fortunes, the descendants of heroes, men of power and place, of
    family pride, of national associations, were not more proud,
    more gallant, than was Prentiss, for "he was reckoned among the
    noblest Romans of them all."</p>

    <p>Each step in his new fortune seemed only to elicit new
    qualities for admiration. At the forum he dazzled&mdash;the
    jury and the judge were confounded&mdash;the crowd carried him
    to the stump, and the multitude listened as to one inspired.
    Fair ladies vied with each other in waving tiny hands in token
    of admiration&mdash;the stolid judges of the Supreme Court
    wondered at the mind of the apparent boy&mdash;even the walls
    of Congress echoed forth pæans to his praise. His course was as
    rapid and brilliant as that of the meteor that suddenly springs
    athwart the heavens, but he was human and accomplished his
    task, herculean as he was, at the price of an injured
    constitution.</p>

    <p>In personal appearance Prentiss was eminently handsome, and
    yet eminently manly. Although of medium height, there was that
    in the carriage of his head that was astonishingly impressive.
    I shall never forget him on one occasion, "in '44," when he
    rose at a public meeting to reply to an antagonist worthy of
    his steel. His whole soul was roused, his high smooth forehead
    fairly coruscated. He remained silent for some seconds, and
    only <i>looked</i>. The bald eagle never glanced so fiercely
    from his eyry. It seemed as if his deep blue eye would distend
    until it swallowed up the thousands of his audience. For an
    instant the effect was painful; he saw it and smiled, when a
    cheer burst from the admiring multitude that fairly shook the
    earth.</p>

    <p>His voice was clear and sweet, and could be heard at an
    immense distance, and yet, to be all like Demosthenes, he had a
    perceptible impediment in his speech. As a reader he had no
    superior. His narration was clear and unadorned, proper
    sentences were subduedly humorous, but the impressive parts
    were delivered with an effect that reminded me of the elder
    Kean.</p>

    <p>His imagination was unsurpassed, and the rich stores of his
    mind supplied him with never-ending material, quoted and
    original. The slightest allusion to anything gave him the key
    to all its peculiarities if he had occasion to allude to the
    diamond, its bed in the Golconda, its discovery by some poor
    native, its being associated with commerce, its polish by the
    lapidary, its adorning the neck of beauty, its rays brilliant
    and serene, its birth, its life, its history, all flashed upon
    him. So with every idea in the vast storehouse of his mind. He
    seemed to know all things, in mass and in particulars, never
    confused, never at a loss&mdash;the hearer listened, wondered,
    and dreamed. Thoughts of moment came forth as demanded, but ten
    thousand other thoughts rare and beautiful, continued to bubble
    up, after all effort ceased.</p>

    <p>No man had a more delicate or subtle wit than Prentiss, or a
    more Falstaffian humor when it suited his purpose. Who will
    ever forget the spending of a social dinner hour with him, when
    his health was high and his mind at ease? Who so
    lovely?&mdash;who so refined? What delight was exhibited by
    sweet ladies who listened to his words! Who could so eloquently
    discourse of roses and buds, of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page290"
       id="page290"></a>[pg 290]</span> lilies and pearls, of eyes
       and graces, of robes and angels, and yet never offend the
       most sensitive of the sex, or call other than the blush of
       pleasure and joy to the cheek? Who could, on the "public
       day," ascend so gracefully from the associations of tariffs,
       and banks, and cotton, and sugar, to greet the fair ladies
       that honored him with their presence? How he would lean
       toward them, as he dwelt upon "the blessed of all God's
       handiwork," compared their bright eyes to "day-stars" that
       lit up the dark recesses of his own clouded imagination; and
       how he would revel, like another Puck, among the rays and
       beams of smiles called forth by his own happy
       compliments&mdash;and how he would change from all this, and
       in an instant seemingly arm himself with the thunderbolts of
       Jove, which he would dash with appalling sound among his
       antagonists, or at principles he opposed, and yet with such
       a charm, with such a manner, that these very daughters of
       the sunny South who had listened to his syren-song so
       admiringly, would now stare, and wonder, and pallor, and yet
       listen, even as one gazes over the precipice, and is
       fascinated at the very nearness to destruction.</p>

    <p>Prentiss had originally a constitution of iron; his frame
    was so perfect in its organization, that, in spite of the most
    extraordinary negligence of health, his muscles had all the
    compactness, glossiness, and distinctiveness of one who had
    specially trained by diet and exercise. It was this
    constitution that enabled him to accomplish so much in so short
    a time. He could almost wholly discard sleep for weeks, with
    apparent impunity; he could eat or starve; do anything that
    would kill ordinary men, yet never feel a twinge of pain. I saw
    him once amidst a tremendous political excitement; he had been
    talking, arguing, dining, visiting, and traveling, without rest
    for three whole days. His companions would steal away at times
    for sleep, but Prentiss was like an ever-busy spirit, here, and
    there, and everywhere. The morning of the fourth day came, and
    he was to appear before an audience familiar with his fame, but
    one that had never heard him speak; an audience critical in the
    last degree, he desired to succeed, for more was depending than
    he had ever before had cause to stake upon such an occasion.
    Many felt a fear that he would be unprepared. I mingled in the
    expecting crowd: I saw ladies who had never honored the stump
    with their presence struggling for seats, counselors,
    statesmen, and professional men, the elite of a great city,
    were gathered together. An hour before I had seen Prentiss,
    still apparently ignorant of his engagement.</p>

    <p>The time of trial came, and the remarkable man presented
    himself, the very picture of buoyant health, of unbroken rest.
    All this had been done <i>by the unyielding resolve of his
    will</i>&mdash;his triumph was complete; high-wrought
    expectations were more than realized, prejudice was demolished,
    professional jealousy silenced, and he descended from the
    rostrum, freely accorded his proper place among the orators and
    statesmen of the "Southern Metropolis."</p>

    <p>Mr. Clay visited the South in the fall of '44, and, as he
    was then candidate for the Presidency, he attracted in New
    Orleans, if possible, more than usual notice. His hotel was the
    St. Charles; toward noon he reached that magnificent palace.
    The streets presented a vast ocean of heads, and every building
    commanding a view was literally covered with human beings. The
    great "Statesman of the West" presented himself to the
    multitude between the tall columns of the finest portico in the
    world. The scene was beyond description, and of vast interest.
    As the crowd swayed to and fro, a universal shout was raised
    for Mr. Clay to speak; he uttered a sentence or two, waved his
    hand in adieu, and escaped amidst the prevailing confusion.
    Prentiss meanwhile was at a side window, evidently unconscious
    of being himself noticed, gazing upon what was passing with all
    the delight of the humblest spectator. Suddenly his name was
    announced. He attempted to withdraw from public gaze, but his
    friends pushed him forward. Again his name was shouted, hats
    and caps were thrown in the air, and he was finally compelled
    to show himself on the portico. With remarkable delicacy, he
    chose a less prominent place than that previously occupied by
    Mr. Clay, although perfectly visible. He thanked his friends
    for their kindness by repeated bows, and by such smiles as he
    alone could give. "A speech! A speech!" thundered a thousand
    voices. Prentiss lifted his hand; in an instant everything was
    still&mdash;then pointing to the group that surrounded Mr.
    Clay, he said, "Fellow-citizens, when the eagle is soaring in
    the sky, the owls and the bats retire to their holes." And long
    before the shout that followed this remark had ceased, Prentiss
    had disappeared amid the multitude.</p>

    <p>But the most extraordinary exhibition of Prentiss' powers of
    mind and endurance of body, was shown while he was running for
    Congress. He had the whole State to canvass, and the magnitude
    of the work was just what he desired. From what I have learned
    from anecdotes, that canvass must have presented some scenes
    combining the highest mental and physical exertion that was
    ever witnessed in the world. Prentiss was in perfect health,
    and in the first blush of success, and it cannot be doubted but
    that his best efforts of oratory were then made, and now live
    recorded only in the fading memories of his hearers. An
    incident illustrative of the time is remembered, that may hear
    repeating.</p>

    <p>The whole state of Mississippi was alive with excitement;
    for the moment, she felt that her sovereign dignity had been
    trifled with, and that her reputation demanded the return of
    Prentiss to Congress. Crowds followed him from place to place,
    making a gala time of weeks together. Among the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page291"
       id="page291"></a>[pg 291]</span> shrewd worldlings who take
       advantage of such times "to coin money," was the proprietor
       of a traveling menagerie, and he soon found out that the
       multitude followed Prentiss. Getting the list of that
       remarkable man's "appointments," he filled up his own, and
       it was soon noticed as a remarkable coincidence, that the
       orator always "arrived along with the other 'lions.'" The
       reason of this meeting was discovered, and the "boys"
       decided that Prentiss should "next time" speak from the top
       of the lion's cage. Never was the menagerie more crowded. At
       the proper time, the candidate gratified his constituents,
       and mounted his singular rostrum. I was told by a person,
       who professed to be an eye witness, that the whole affair
       presented a singular mixture of the terrible and the
       comical. Prentiss was, as usual, eloquent, and, as if
       ignorant of the novel circumstances with which he was
       surrounded, went deeply into the matter in hand, his
       election. For a while the audience and the animals were
       quiet, the former listening, the latter eyeing the speaker
       with grave intensity. The first burst of applause
       electrified the menagerie; the elephant threw his trunk into
       the air and echoed back the noise, while the tigers and
       bears significantly growled. On went Prentiss, and as each
       peculiar animal vented his rage or approbation, he most
       ingeniously wrought in its habits, as a facsimile of some
       man or passion. In the meanwhile, the stately king of
       beasts, who had been quietly treading the mazes of his
       prison, became alarmed at the footsteps over his head, and
       placing his mouth upon the floor of his cage, made
       everything shake by his terrible roar. This, joined with the
       already excited feelings of the audience, caused the ladies
       to shriek, and a fearful commotion for a moment followed.
       Prentiss, equal to every occasion, changed his tone and
       manner; he commenced a playful strain, and introduced the
       fox, the jackal, and hyena, and capped the climax by
       likening some well known political opponent to a grave
       baboon that presided over the "cage with monkeys"; the
       resemblance was instantly recognized, and bursts of laughter
       followed, that literally set many into convulsions. The
       baboon, all unconscious of the attention he was attracting,
       suddenly assumed a grimace, and then a serious face, when
       Prentiss exclaimed&mdash;"I see, my fine fellow, that your
       feelings are hurt by my unjust comparison, and I humbly beg
       your pardon." The effect of all this may be vaguely
       imagined, but it cannot be described.</p>

    <p>Of Prentiss' power before a jury too much cannot be said.
    Innumerable illustrations might be gathered up, showing that he
    far surpassed any living advocate. "The trial of the
    Wilkinsons" might be cited, although it was far from being one
    of his best efforts. Two young men, only sons, and deeply
    attached as friends, quarreled, and in the mad excitement of
    the moment, one of them was killed. Upon the trial, the
    testimony of the mother of the deceased was so direct, that it
    seemed to render "the clearing of the prisoner" hopeless.
    Prentiss spoke to the witness in the blandest manner and most
    courtly style. The mother, arrayed in weeds, and bowed down
    with sorrow, turned toward Prentiss, and answered his inquiries
    with all the dignity of a perfectly accomplished lady&mdash;she
    calmly uttered the truth, and every word she spoke rendered the
    defense apparently more hopeless.</p>

    <p>"Would you punish that young man with death?" said Prentiss,
    pointing to the prisoner.</p>

    <p>The questioned looked, and answered&mdash;"He has made me
    childless, let the law take its course."</p>

    <p>"And would wringing his mother's heart and hurrying her gray
    hairs with sorrow into the grave, by rendering her childless,
    assuage your grief?"</p>

    <p>All present were dissolved in tears&mdash;even convulsive
    sobbing was heard in the courtroom.</p>

    <p>"No!" said the witness, with all the gushing tenderness of a
    mother&mdash;"No! I would not add a sorrow to her heart, nor
    that of her son!"</p>

    <p>Admissions in the evidence followed, and hopes were uttered
    for the prisoner's acquittal, that changed the whole character
    of the testimony. What was a few moments before so dark, grew
    light, and without the slightest act that might be construed
    into an unfair advantage, in the hands of Prentiss, the witness
    pleaded for the accused.</p>

    <p>Soon after Mr. Prentiss settled in New Orleans, a meeting
    was held to raise funds for the erection of a suitable monument
    to Franklin. On that occasion, the lamented Wilde and the
    accomplished McCaleb delivered ornate and chaste addresses upon
    the value of art, and the policy of enriching New Orleans with
    its exhibition. At the close of the meeting, as the audience
    rose to depart, some one discovered Prentiss, and calling his
    name, it was echoed from all sides&mdash;he tried to escape,
    but was literally carried on the stand.</p>

    <p>As a rich specimen of off-hand eloquence, I think the
    address he delivered on that occasion was unequaled. Unlike any
    other speech, he had the arts to deal with, and of course the
    associations were of surpassing splendor. I knew that he was
    ignorant of the technicalities of art, and had paid but little
    attention to their study, and my surprise was unbounded to see
    him, thus unexpectedly called upon, instantly arrange in his
    mind ideas, and expressing facts and illustrations that would
    have done honor to Burke, when dwelling upon the sublime and
    beautiful. Had he been bred to the easel, or confined to the
    sculptor's room, he could not have been more familiar with the
    details of the studio&mdash;he painted with all the brilliancy
    of Titian, and with the correctness of Raphael, while his
    images in marble combined the softness of Praxiteles, and the
    nervous energy of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page292"
       id="page292"></a>[pg 292]</span> Michael Angelo. All this
       with Prentiss was intuition&mdash;I believe that the whole
       was the spontaneous thought of the moment, the crude
       outlines that floated through his mind being filled up by
       the intuitive teachings of his surpassing genius. His
       conclusion was gorgeous&mdash;he passed Napoleon to the
       summit of the Alps&mdash;his hearers saw him and his steel
       clad warriors threading the snows of Mount St. Bernard, and
       having gained the dizzy height, Prentiss represented "the
       man of destiny" looking down upon the sunny plains of Italy,
       and then with a mighty swoop, descending from the clouds and
       making the grasp of Empire secondary to that of Art.</p>

    <p>I had the melancholy pleasure of hearing his last, and, it
    would seem to me, his greatest speech. Toward the close of the
    last Presidential campaign, I found him in the interior of the
    State, endeavoring to recruit his declining health. He had been
    obliged to avoid all public speaking, and had gone far into the
    country to get away from excitement. But there was a
    "gathering" near by his temporary home, and he consented to be
    present. It was late in the evening when he ascended the
    "stand," which was supported by the trunks of two magnificent
    forest trees, through which the setting sun poured with
    picturesque effect. The ravages of ill health were apparent
    upon his face, and his high massive forehead was paler, and
    seemingly more transparent than usual. His audience, some three
    or four hundred, was composed in a large degree of his old and
    early friends. He seemed to feel deeply, and as there was
    nothing to oppose, he assumed the style of the mild and
    beautiful&mdash;he casually alluded to the days of his early
    coming among his Southern friends&mdash;of hours of pleasure he
    had massed, and of the hopes of the future. In a few moments
    the bustle and confusion natural to a fatiguing day of
    political wrangling ceased&mdash;one straggler after another
    suspended his noisy demonstration, and gathered near the
    speaker. Soon a mass of silent but heart-heaving humanity was
    crowded compactly before him. Had Prentiss, on that occasion,
    held the very heart-strings of his auditors in his hand, he
    could not have had them more in his power. For an hour he
    continued, rising from one important subject to another, until
    the breath was fairly suspended in the excitement. An
    uninterested spectator would have supposed that he had used
    sorcery in thus transfixing his auditors. While all others
    forgot, he noticed the day was drawing to a close, he turned
    and looked toward the setting sun, and apostrophized its fading
    glory&mdash;then in his most touching voice and manner,
    concluded as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Friends&mdash;That glorious orb reminds me that the day is
    spent, and that I too must close. Ere we part, let me hope that
    it may be our good fortune to end our days in the same
    splendor, and that when the evening of life comes, we may sink
    to rest with the clouds that close in on our departure,
    gold-tipped with the glorious effulgence of a well-spent
    life!"</p>

    <p>In conclusion, I would ask, will some historian, who can
    sympathize with the noble dead, gather up the now fleeting
    memorials that still live in memory, and combine them together,
    that future generations may know something of the mighty mind
    of Prentiss.</p>

    <p>The remains of the orator must ever be imperfect&mdash;the
    tone of voice&mdash;the flashing eye&mdash;the occasion, and
    the mighty shout of the multitude, cannot be impressed; but
    still Prentiss has left enough in his brilliant career, if
    treasured up, to show posterity that he was every inch a man.
    Let his fragmentary printed speeches&mdash;let the
    reminiscences of his friends that treat of his power as an
    orator, be brought together, and unsatisfactory as they may be,
    there will be found left intrinsic value enough to accomplish
    the object. There will be in the fluted column, though
    shattered and defaced, an Ionian beauty that will tell
    unerringly of the magnificent temple that it once adorned.</p>

    <h2>THE CHEMISTRY OF A CANDLE.</h2>

    <p>The Wilkinsons were having a small party,&mdash;it consisted
    of themselves and Uncle Bagges&mdash;at which the younger
    members of the family, home for the holidays, had been just
    admitted to assist after dinner. Uncle Bagges was a gentleman
    from whom his affectionate relatives cherished expectations of
    a testamentary nature. Hence the greatest attention was paid by
    them to the wishes of Mr. Bagges, as well as to every
    observation which he might be pleased to make.</p>

    <p>"Eh! what? you sir," said Mr. Bagges, facetiously addressing
    himself to his eldest nephew, Harry,&mdash;"Eh! what? I am glad
    to hear, sir, that you are doing well at school. Now&mdash;eh?
    now, are you clever enough to tell where was Moses when he put
    the candle out?"</p>

    <p>"That depends, uncle," said the young gentleman, "on whether
    he had lighted the candle to see with at night, or by daylight,
    to seal a letter."</p>

    <p>"Eh! Very good, now! 'Pon my word, very good," exclaimed
    Uncle Bagges. "You must be Lord Chancellor, sir&mdash;Lord
    Chancellor, one of these days."</p>

    <p>"And now, uncle," asked Harry, who was a favorite with his
    uncle, "can you tell me what you do when you put a candle
    out?"</p>

    <p>"Clap an extinguisher on it, you young rogue, to be
    sure."</p>

    <p>"Oh! but I mean, you cut off its supply of oxygen," said
    Master Harry.</p>

    <p>"Cut off its ox's&mdash;eh? what? I shall cut off your nose,
    you young dog, one of these fine days."</p>

    <p>"He means something he heard at the Royal Institution,"
    observed Mrs. Wilkinson. "He reads a great deal about
    chemistry, and he attended Professor Faraday's lectures there
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page293"
       id="page293"></a>[pg 293]</span> on the chemical history of
       a candle, and has been full of it ever since."</p>

    <p>"Now, you sir," said Uncle Bagges, "come you here to me, and
    tell me what you have to say about this chemical, eh?&mdash;or
    comical: which?&mdash;this comical chemical history of a
    candle."</p>

    <p>"He'll bore you, Bagges," said Mr. Wilkinson. "Harry, don't
    be troublesome to your uncle."</p>

    <p>"Troublesome! Oh, not at all. He amuses me. I like to hear
    him. So let him teach his old uncle the comicality and
    chemicality of a farthing rushlight."</p>

    <p>"A wax candle will be nicer and cleaner, uncle, and answer
    the same purpose. There's one on the mantel-shelf. Let me light
    it.</p>

    <p>"Take care you don't burn your fingers, Or set anything on
    fire," said Mrs. Wilkinson.</p>

    <p>"Now, uncle," commenced Harry, having drawn his chair to the
    side of Mr. Bagges, "we have got our candle burning. What do
    you see?"</p>

    <p>"Let me put on my spectacles," answered the uncle.</p>

    <p>"Look down on the top of the candle around the wick. See, it
    is a little cup full of melted wax. The heat of the flame has
    melted the wax just round the wick. The cold air keeps the
    outside of it hard, so as to make the rim of it. The melted wax
    in the little cup goes up through the wick to be burnt, just as
    oil does in the wick of a lamp. What do you think makes it go
    up, uncle?"</p>

    <p>"Why&mdash;why, the flame draws it up, doesn't it?"</p>

    <p>"Not exactly, uncle. It goes up through little tiny passages
    in the cotton wick, because very, very small channels, or
    pipes, or pores, have the power in themselves of sucking up
    liquids. What they do it by is called cap&mdash;something."</p>

    <p>"Capillary attraction, Harry," suggested Mr. Wilkinson.</p>

    <p>"Yes, that's it; just as a sponge sucks up water, or a bit
    of lump-sugar the little drop of tea or coffee left in the
    bottom of a cup. But I mustn't say much more about this, or
    else you will tell me I am doing something very much like
    teaching my grandmother to&mdash;you know what."</p>

    <p>"Your grandmother, eh, young sharp-shins?"</p>

    <p>"No&mdash;I mean my uncle. Now, I'll blow the candle out,
    like Moses; not to be in the dark, though, but to see into what
    it is. Look at the smoke rising from the wick. I'll hold a bit
    of lighted paper in the smoke, so as not to touch the wick. But
    see, for all that, the candle lights again. So this shows that
    the melted wax sucked up through the wick is turned into vapor;
    and the vapor burns. The heat of the burning vapor keeps on
    melting more wax, and that is sucked up too within the flame,
    and turned into vapor, and burnt, and so on till the was is all
    used up, and the candle is gone. So the flame, uncle, you see,
    is the last of the candle, and the candle seems to go through
    the flame into nothing&mdash;although it doesn't, but goes into
    several things, and isn't it curious, as Professor Faraday
    said, that the candle should look so splendid and glorious in
    going away?"</p>

    <p>"How well he remembers, doesn't he?" observed Mrs.
    Wilkinson.</p>

    <p>"I dare say," proceeded Harry, "that the flame of the candle
    looks flat to you; but if we were to put a lamp glass over it,
    so as to shelter it from the draught, you would see it is
    round,&mdash;round sideways and running up to a peak. It is
    drawn up by the hot air; you know that hot air always rises,
    and that is the way smoke is taken up the chimney. What should
    you think was in the middle of the flame?"</p>

    <p>"I should say fire," replied Uncle Bagges.</p>

    <p>"Oh, no! The flame is hollow. The bright flame we see is
    something no thicker than a thin peel, or skin; and it doesn't
    touch the wick. Inside of it is the vapor I told you of just
    now. If you put one end of a bent pipe into the middle of the
    flame, and let the other end of the pipe dip into a bottle, the
    vapor or gas from the candle will mix with the air there; and
    if you set fire to the mixture of gas from the candle and air
    in the bottle, it would go off with a bang."</p>

    <p>"I wish you'd do that, Harry," said Master Tom, the younger
    brother of the juvenile lecturer.</p>

    <p>"I want the proper things," answered Harry. "Well, uncle,
    the flame of the candle is a little shining case, with gas in
    the inside of it, and air on the outside, so that the case of
    flame is between the air and the gas. The gas keeps going into
    the flame to burn, and when the candle burns properly, none of
    it ever passes out through the flame; and none of the air ever
    gets in through the flame to the gas. The greatest heat of the
    candle is in this skin, or peel, or case of flame."</p>

    <p>"Case of flame!" repeated Mr. Bagges. "Live and learn. I
    should have thought a candle-flame was as thick as my poor old
    noddle."</p>

    <p>"I can show you the contrary," said Harry. "I take this
    piece of white paper, look, and hold it a second or two down
    upon the candle-flame, keeping the flame very steady. Now I'll
    rub off the black of the smoke, and&mdash;there&mdash;you find
    that the paper is scorched in the shape of a ring; but inside
    the ring it is only dirtied, and not singed at all."</p>

    <p>"Seeing is believing," remarked the uncle.</p>

    <p>"But," proceeded Harry, "there is more in the candle-flame
    than the gas that comes out of the candle. You know a candle
    won't burn without air. There must be always air around the
    gas, and touching it like, to make it burn. If a candle hasn't
    got enough air, it goes out, or burns badly, so that some of
    the vapor inside of the flame comes out through it in the form
    of smoke, and this is the reason of a candle smoking. So now
    you know why a great clumsy dip smokes more than a neat wax
    candle; it is because the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page294"
       id="page294"></a>[pg 294]</span> thick wick of the dip makes
       too much fuel in proportion to the air that can get to
       it."</p>

    <p>"Dear me! Well, I suppose there is a reason for everything,"
    exclaimed the young philosopher's mamma.</p>

    <p>"What should you say now," continued Harry, "if I told you
    that the smoke that comes out of a candle is the very thing
    that makes a candle light? Yes; a candle shines by consuming
    its own smoke. The smoke of a candle is a cloud of small dust,
    and the little grains of the dust are bits of charcoal, or
    carbon, as chemists call it. They are made in the flame, and
    burnt in the flame, and, while burning, make the flame bright.
    They are burnt the moment they are made; but the flame goes on
    making more of them as fast as it burns them: and that is how
    it keeps bright. The place they are made in, is in the ease of
    flame itself, where the strong heat is. The great heat
    separates them from the gas which conies from the melted wax,
    and, as soon as they touch the air on the outside of the thin
    case of flame, they burn."</p>

    <p>"Can you tell how it is that the little bits of carbon came
    the brightness of the flame?" asked Mr. Wilkinson.</p>

    <p>"Because they are pieces of solid matter," answered Harry.
    "To make a flame shine, there must always be some
    solid&mdash;or at least liquid-matter in it."</p>

    <p>"Very good." said Mr. Bagges,&mdash;"solid stuff necessary
    to brightness."</p>

    <p>"Some gases and other things," resumed Harry, "that burn
    with a flame you can hardly see, burn splendidly when something
    solid is put into them. Oxygen and hydrogen&mdash;tell me if I
    use too hard words, uncle&mdash;oxygen and hydrogen gases, if
    mixed together and blown through a pipe, burn with plenty of
    heat but with very little light. But if their flame is blown
    upon a piece of quick-lime, it gets so bright as to be quite
    dazzling, Make the smoke of oil of turpentine pass through the
    same flame, and it gives the flame a beautiful brightness
    directly."</p>

    <p>"I wonder," observed Uncle Bagges, "what has made you such a
    bright youth."</p>

    <p>"Taking after uncle, perhaps," retorted his nephew. "Don't
    put my candle and me out. Well, carbon, or charcoal is what
    causes the brightness of all lamps, and candles, and other
    common lights; so, of course, there is carbon in what they are
    all made of."</p>

    <p>"So carbon is smoke, eh? and light is owing to your carbon.
    Giving light out of smoke, eh? as they say in the classics,"
    observed Mr. Bagges.</p>

    <p>"But what becomes of the candle," pursued Harry, "as it
    burns away? where does it go?"</p>

    <p>"Nowhere," said his mamma, "I should think. It burns to
    nothing."</p>

    <p>"Oh, dear, no!" said Harry, "everything&mdash;everybody goes
    somewhere."</p>

    <p>"Eh!&mdash;rather an important consideration, that," Mr.
    Bagges moralized.</p>

    <p>"You can see it goes into smoke, which makes soot, for one
    thing," pursued Harry. "There are other things it goes into,
    not to be seen by only looking, but you can get to see them by
    taking the right means,&mdash;just put your hand over the
    candle, uncle."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, young gentleman, I had rather be excused."</p>

    <p>"Not close enough down to burn you, uncle; higher up.
    There&mdash;you feel a stream of hot air; so something seems to
    rise from the candle. Suppose you were to put a very long
    slender gas-burner over the flame, and let the flame burn just
    within the end of it, as if it were a chimney,&mdash;some of
    the hot steam would go up and come out at the top, but a sort
    of dew would be left behind in the glass chimney, if the
    chimney was cold enough when you put it on. There are ways of
    collecting this sort of dew, and when it is collected it turns
    out to be really water. I am not joking, uncle. Water is one of
    the things which the candle turns into in burning,&mdash;water
    coming out of fire. A jet of oil gives above a pint of water in
    burning. In some lighthouses they burn, Professor Faraday says,
    up to two gallons of oil in a night, and if the windows are
    cold the steam from the oil clouds the inside of the windows,
    and, in frosty weather, freezes into ice."</p>

    <p>"Water out of a candle, eh?" exclaimed Mr. Bagges. "As hard
    to get, I should have thought, as blood out of a post. Where
    does it come from?"</p>

    <p>"Part from the wax, and part from the air, and yet not a
    drop of it comes either from the air or the wax. What do you
    make of that, uncle?"</p>

    <p>"Eh? Oh! I'm no hand at riddles. Give it up."</p>

    <p>"No riddle at all, uncle. The part that comes from the wax
    isn't water, and the part that comes from the air isn't water,
    but when put together they become water. Water is a mixture of
    two things then. This can be shown. Put some iron wire or
    turnings into a gun barrel open at both ends. Heat the middle
    of the barrel red-hot in a little furnace. Keep the heat up,
    and send the steam of boiling water through the red-hot gun
    barrel. What will come out at the other end of the barrel won't
    be steam; it will be gas, which doesn't turn to water again
    when it gets cold, and which burns if you put a light to it.
    Take the turnings out of the gun-barrel, and you will find them
    changed to rust, and heavier than when they were put in. Part
    of the water is the gas that comes out of the barrel, the other
    part is what mixes with the iron turnings, and changes them to
    rust, and makes them heavier. You can fill a Wadder with the
    gas that comes out of the gun-barrel, or you can pass bubbles
    of it up into a jar of water turned upside down in a trough,
    and, as I said, you can make this part of the water burn."</p>

    <p>"Eh?" cried Mr. Bagges. "Upon my word! One of these day, we
    shall have you setting the Thames on
    fire."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page295"
       id="page295"></a>[pg 295]</span>

    <p>"Nothing more easy," said Harry, "than to burn part of the
    Thames, or of any other water; I mean the gas that I have just
    told you about, which is called hydrogen. In burning, hydrogen
    produces water again, like the flame of a candle. Indeed,
    hydrogen is that part of the water formed by a candle burning,
    that comes from the wax. All things that have hydrogen in them
    produce water in burning, and the more there is in them the
    more they produce. When pure hydrogen burns, nothing comes from
    it but water, no smoke or soot at all. If you were to burn one
    ounce of it, the water you would get would be just nine ounces.
    There are many ways of making hydrogen besides out of steam by
    the hot gun-barrel. I could show it you in a moment by pouring
    a little sulphuric acid mixed with water into a bottle upon a
    few zinc or steel filings, and putting a cork in the bottle
    with a little pipe through it, and setting fire to the gas that
    would come from the mouth of the pipe. We should find the flame
    very hot, but having scarcely any brightness. I should like you
    to see the curious qualities of hydrogen, particularly how
    light it is, so as to carry things up in the air; and I wish I
    had a small balloon to fill with it, and make go up to the
    ceiling, or a bag-pipe full of it to blow soap-bubbles with,
    and show how much faster they rise than common ones, blown with
    the breath."</p>

    <p>"So do I," interposed Master Tom.</p>

    <p>"And so," resumed Harry, "hydrogen, you know, uncle, is part
    of water, and just one-ninth part."</p>

    <p>"As hydrogen is to water, so is a tailor to an ordinary
    individual, eh?" Mr. Bagges remarked.</p>

    <p>"Well, now then, uncle, if hydrogen is the tailor's part of
    the water, what are the other eight parts? The iron turnings
    used to make hydrogen in the gun-barrel, and rusted, take just
    those eight parts from the water in the shape of steam, and are
    so much the heavier. Burn iron turnings in the air, and they
    make the same rust, and gain just the same in weight. So the
    other eight parts must be found in the air for one thing, and
    in the rusted iron turnings for another, and they must also be
    in the water; and now the question is, how to get at them?"</p>

    <p>"Out of the water? Fish for them, I should say," suggested
    Mr. Bagges.</p>

    <p>"Why, so we can," said Harry. "Only, instead of hooks and
    lines, we must use wires&mdash;two wires, one from one end, the
    other from the other, of a galvanic battery. Put the points of
    these wires into water, a little distance apart, and they
    instantly take the water to pieces. If they are of copper, or a
    metal that will rust easily, one of them begins to rust, and
    air-bubbles come up from the other. These bubbles are hydrogen.
    The other part of the water mixes with the end of the wire and
    makes rust. But if the wires are of gold, or a metal that does
    not rust easily, air-bubbles rise from the ends of both wires.
    Collect the bubbles from both wires in a tube, and fire them,
    and they turn to water again; and this water is exactly the
    same weight as the quantity that has been changed into the two
    gases. Now then, uncle, what should you think water was
    composed of?"</p>

    <p>"Eh? well&mdash;I suppose of those very identical two gases,
    young gentleman."</p>

    <p>"Right, uncle. Recollect that the gas from one of the wires
    was hydrogen, the one-ninth of water. What should you guess the
    gas from the other wire to be?"</p>

    <p>"Stop&mdash;eh?&mdash;wait a bit&mdash;eh?&mdash;oh! why,
    the other eight-ninths, to be sure."</p>

    <p>"Good again, uncle. Now this gas that is eight-ninths of
    water is the gas called oxygen that I mentioned just now. This
    is a very curious gas. It won't burn in air at all itself, like
    gas from a lamp, but it has a wonderful power of making things
    burn that are lighted and put into it. If you fill a jar with
    it&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"How do you manage that?" Mr. Bagges inquired.</p>

    <p>"You fill the jar with water," answered Harry, "and you
    stand it upside down in a vessel full of water too. Then you
    let bubbles of the gas up into the jar, and they turn out the
    water and take its place. Put a stopper in the neck of the jar,
    or hold a glass plate against the mouth of it, and you can take
    it out of the water and so have bottled oxygen. A lighted
    candle put into a jar of oxygen blazes up directly, and is
    consumed before you can say Jack Robinson. Charcoal burns away
    in it as fast, with beautiful bright sparks&mdash;phosphorus
    with a light that dazzles you to look at&mdash;and a piece of
    iron or steel just made red-hot at the end first, is burnt in
    oxygen quicker than a stick would be in common air. The
    experiment of burning things in oxygen beats any
    fire-works."</p>

    <p>"Oh, how jolly!" exclaimed Tom.</p>

    <p>"Now we see, uncle," Harry continued, "that water is
    hydrogen and oxygen united together, that water is got wherever
    hydrogen is burnt in common air, that a candle won't burn
    without air, and that when a candle burns there is hydrogen in
    it burning, and forming water. Now, then, where does the
    hydrogen of the candle get the oxygen from, to turn into water
    with it?"</p>

    <p>"From the air, eh?"</p>

    <p>"Just so. I can't stop to tell you of the other things which
    there is oxygen in, and the many beautiful and amusing ways of
    getting it. But as there is oxygen in the air, and as oxygen
    makes things burn at such a rate, perhaps you wonder why air
    does not make things burn as fast as oxygen. The reason is,
    that there is something else in the air that mixes with the
    oxygen and weakens it."</p>

    <p>"Makes a sort of gaseous grog of it, eh?" said Mr. Bagges.
    "But how is that proved?"</p>

    <p>"Why, there is a gas, called nitrous gas, which, if you mix
    it with oxygen, takes all the oxygen into itself, and the
    mixture of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page296"
       id="page296"></a>[pg 296]</span> nitrous gas and oxygen, if
       you put water with it, goes into the water. Mix nitrous gas
       and air together in a jar over water, and the nitrous gas
       takes away the oxygen, and then the water sucks up the mixed
       oxygen and nitrous gas, and that part of the air which
       weakens the oxygen is left behind. Burning phosphorus in
       confined air will also take all the oxygen from it, and
       there are other ways of doing the same thing. The portion of
       the air left behind is called nitrogen. You wouldn't know it
       from common air by the look; it has no color, taste, nor
       smell, and it won't burn. But things won't burn in it,
       either; and anything on fire put into it goes out directly.
       It isn't fit to breathe, and a mouse, or any animal, shut up
       in it, dies. It isn't poisonous, though; creatures only die
       in it for want of oxygen. We breathe it with oxygen, and
       then it does no harm, but good: for if we breathed pure
       oxygen, we should breathe away so violently, that we should
       soon breathe our life out. In the same way, if the air were
       nothing but oxygen, a candle would not last above a
       minute.</p>

    <p>"What a tallow-chandler's bill we should have!" remarked
    Mrs. Wilkinson.</p>

    <p>"'If a house were on fire in oxygen,' as Professor Faraday
    said, 'every iron bar, or rafter, or pillar, every nail and
    iron tool, and the fire-place itself; all the zinc and copper
    roofs, and leaden coverings, and gutters, and pipes, would
    consume and burn, increasing the combustion.'"</p>

    <p>"That would be, indeed, burning 'like a house on fire,'"
    observed Mr. Bagges.</p>

    <p>"'Think,'" said Harry, continuing his quotation, "'of the
    Houses of Parliament, or a steam-engine manufactory. Think of
    an iron proof-chest no proof against oxygen. Think of a
    locomotive and its train,&mdash;every engine, every carriage,
    and even every rail would be set on fire and burnt up.' So now,
    uncle, I think you see what the use of nitrogen is, and
    especially how it prevents a candle from burning out too
    fast."</p>

    <p>"Eh?" said Mr. Bagges. "Well, I will say I do think we are
    under considerable obligations to nitrogen."</p>

    <p>"I have explained to you, uncle," pursued Harry, "how a
    candle, in burning, turns into water. But it turns into
    something else. besides that. There is a stream of hot air
    going up from it that won't condense into dew; some of that is
    the nitrogen of the air which the candle has taken all the
    oxygen from. But there is more in it than nitrogen. Hold a long
    glass tube over a candle, so that the stream of hot air from it
    may go up through the tube. Hold a jar over the end of the tube
    to collect some of the stream of hot air. Put some lime-water,
    which looks quite clear, into the jar; stop the jar, and shake
    it up. The lime-water, which was quite clear before, turns
    milky. Then there is something made by the burning of the
    candle that changes the color of the lime-water. That is a gas,
    too, and you can collect it, and examine it. It is to be got
    from several things, and is a part of all chalk, marble, and
    the shells of eggs or of shell-fish. The easiest way to make it
    is by pouring muriatic or sulphuric acid on chalk or marble.
    The marble or chalk begins to hiss or bubble, and you can
    collect the bubbles in the same way that you can oxygen. The
    gas made by the candle in burning, and which also is got out of
    the chalk and marble, is called carbonic acid. It puts out a
    light in a moment; it kills any animal that breathes it, and it
    is really poisonous to breathe, because it destroys life even
    when mixed with a pretty large quantity of common air. The
    bubbles made by beer when it ferments, are carbonic acid, so is
    the air that fizzes out of soda-water, and it is good to
    swallow though it is deadly to breathe. It is got from chalk by
    burning the chalk as well as by putting acid to it, and burning
    the carbonic acid out of chalk makes the chalk lime. This is
    why people are killed sometimes by getting in the way of the
    wind that blows from lime-kilns."</p>

    <p>"Of which it is advisable carefully to keep to the
    windward." Mr. Wilkinson observed.</p>

    <p>"The most curious thing about carbonic acid gas," proceeded
    Harry, "is its weight. Although it is only a sort of air, it is
    so heavy that you can pour it from one vessel into another. You
    may dip a cup of it and pour it down upon a candle, and it will
    put the candle out, which would astonish an ignorant person;
    because carbonic acid gas is as invisible as the air, and the
    candle seems to be put out by nothing. A soap-bubble or common
    air floats on it like wood on water. Its weight is what makes
    it collect in brewers' vats; and also in wells, where it is
    produced naturally; and owing to its collecting in such places
    it causes the deaths we so often hear about of those who go
    down into them without proper care. It is found in many springs
    of water, more or less; and a great deal of it comes out of the
    earth in some places. Carbonic acid gas is what stupefies the
    dogs in the Grotto del Cane. Well, but how is carbonic acid gas
    made by the candle?"</p>

    <p>"I hope with your candle you'll throw some light upon the
    subject," said Uncle Bagges.</p>

    <p>"I hope so," answered Harry. "Recollect it is the burning of
    the smoke, or soot, or carbon of the candle, that makes the
    candle-flame bright. Also that the candle won't burn without
    air. Likewise that it will not burn in nitrogen, or air that
    has been deprived of oxygen. So the carbon of the candle
    mingles with oxygen, in burning, to make carbonic acid gas;
    just as the hydrogen does to form water. Carbonic acid gas,
    then, is carbon or charcoal dissolved in oxygen. Here is black
    soot getting invisible and changing into air; and this seems
    strange, uncle, doesn't it?"</p>

    <p>"Ahem! Strange, if true," answered Mr. Bagges. "Eh? Well! I
    suppose it's all right."</p>

    <p>"Quite so, uncle. Burn carbon or charcoal either in the air
    or in oxygen, and it is sure always to make carbonic acid, and
    nothing <span class="pagenum"><a name="page297"
       id="page297"></a>[pg 297]</span> else, if it is dry. No dew
       or mist gathers in a cold glass jar if you burn dry charcoal
       in it. The charcoal goes entirely into carbonic acid gas,
       and leaves nothing behind but ashes, which are only earthy
       stuff that was in the charcoal, but not part of the charcoal
       itself. And now, shall I tell you something about
       carbon?"</p>

    <p>"With all my heart," assented Mr. Bagges.</p>

    <p>"I said that there was carbon or charcoal in all common
    lights, so there is in every common kind of fuel. If you heat
    coal or wood away from the air, some gas comes away, and leaves
    behind coke from coal, and charcoal from wood; both carbon,
    though not pure. Heat carbon as much as you will in a close
    vessel, and it does not change in the least; but let the air
    get to it, and then it burns and flies off in carbonic acid
    gas. This makes carbon so convenient for fuel. But it is
    ornamental as well as useful, uncle. The diamond is nothing
    else than carbon."</p>

    <p>"The diamond, eh! You mean the black diamond."</p>

    <p>"No: the diamond, really and truly. The diamond is only
    carbon in the shape of a crystal."</p>

    <p>"Eh? and can't some of your clever chemists crystalize a
    little bit of carbon, and make a Koh-i-noor?"</p>

    <p>"Ah, uncle, perhaps we shall, some day. In the mean time I
    suppose we must be content with making carbon so brilliant as
    it is in the flame of a candle. Well; now you see that a
    candle-flame is vapor burning, and the vapor, in burning, turns
    into water and carbonic acid gas. The oxygen of both the
    carbonic acid gas and the water comes from the air, and the
    hydrogen and carbon together are the vapor. They are distilled
    out of the melted was by the heat. But, you know, carbon alone
    can't be distilled by any heat. It can be distilled, though,
    when it is joined with hydrogen, as it is in the wax, and then
    the mixed hydrogen and carbon rise in gas of the same kind as
    the gas in the streets, and that also is distilled by heat from
    coal. So a candle is a little gas manufactory in itself, that
    burns the gas as fast as it makes it."</p>

    <p>"Haven't you pretty nearly come to your candle's end'!" said
    Mr. Wilkinson.</p>

    <p>"Nearly. I only want to tell uncle, that the burning of a
    candle is almost exactly like our breathing. Breathing is
    consuming oxygen, only not so fast as burning. In breathing we
    throw out water in vapor and carbonic acid from our lungs, and
    take oxygen in. Oxygen is as necessary to support the life of
    the body, as it is to keep up the flame of a candle."</p>

    <p>"So," said Mr. Bagges, "man is a candle, eh? and Shakspeare
    knew that, I suppose, (as he did most things,) when he
    wrote</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>'Out, out, brief candle!'</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"Well, well; we old ones are moulds, and you young squires
    are dips and rushlights, eh? Any more to tell us about the
    candle?"</p>

    <p>"I could tell you a great deal more about oxygen, and
    hydrogen, and carbon, and water, and breathing, that Professor
    Faraday said, if I had time; but you should go and hear him
    yourself, uncle."</p>

    <p>"Eh? well! I think I will. Some of us seniors may learn
    something from a juvenile lecture, at any rate, if given by a
    Faraday. And now, my boy. I will tell you what," added Mr.
    Bagges, "I am very glad to find you so fond of study and
    science; and you deserve to be encouraged: and so I'll give you
    a what-d'ye-call-it'?&mdash;a Galvanic Battery, on your next
    birth-day; and so much for your teaching your old uncle the
    chemistry of a candle."</p>

    <h4>[From a Review of Griswold's <i>Prose Writers of
    America</i>, in the Southern Literary Messenger.]</h4>

    <h2>DANIEL WEBSTER,</h2>

    <h3>AS A STATESMAN, AND AS A MAN OF LETTERS.</h3>

    <p>Mr. Webster is properly selected as the representative of
    the best sense, and highest wisdom, and most consummate
    dignity, of the politics and oratory of the present times,
    because his great intelligence has continued to be so finely
    sensitive to all the influences that stir the action and
    speculation of the country.</p>

    <p>With elements of reason, definite, absolute, and emphatic;
    with principles settled, strenuous, deep and unchangeable as
    his being; his wisdom is yet exquisitely practical: with
    subtlest sagacity it apprehends every change in the
    circumstances in which it is to act, and can accommodate its
    action without loss of vigor, or alteration of its general
    purpose. Its theories always "lean and hearken" to the actual.
    By a sympathy of the mind, almost transcendental in its
    delicacy, its speculations are attracted into a parallelism
    with the logic of life and nature. In most men, that
    intellectual susceptibility by which they are capable of being
    reacted upon by the outer world, and having their principles
    and views expanded, modified or quickened, does not outlast the
    first period of life; from that time they remain fixed and
    rigid in their policy, temper and characteristics; if a new
    phase of society is developed, it must find its exponent in
    other men. But in Webster this fresh suggestive sensibility of
    the judgment has been carried on into the matured and
    determined wisdom of manhood. His perceptions, feelings,
    reasonings, tone, are always up to the level of the hour, or in
    advance of it; sometimes far, very far in advance, as in the
    views thrown out in his speech at Baltimore, on an
    international commercial system, in which he showed that he
    then foresaw both the fate of the tariff and the fallacy of
    free-trade. No man has ever been able to say, or now can say,
    that he is before Webster. The youngest men in the nation look
    to him, not as representing the past, but as leading in the
    future.</p>

    <p>This practicalness and readiness of adaptation are
    instinctive, not voluntary and designed. They are united with
    the most decided preference for certain opinions and the most
    earnest averseness to others. Nothing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page298"
       id="page298"></a>[pg 298]</span> can be less like
       Talleyrand's system of waiting for events. He has never, in
       view of a change which he saw to be inevitable, held himself
       in reserve and uncommitted. What Webster is at any time,
       that he is strenuously, entirely, openly. He has first
       opposed, with every energy of his mind and temper, that
       which, when it has actually come, he is ready to accept, and
       make the best of. He never surrenders in advance a position
       which knows will be carried; he takes his place, and
       delivers battle; he fights as one who is fighting the last
       battle of his country's hopes; he fires the last shot. When
       the smoke and tumult are cleared off, where is Webster! Look
       around for the nearest rallying point which the view
       presents; there he stands, with his hand upon his heart, in
       grim composure; calm, dignified, resolute; neither
       disheartened nor surprised by defeat. "Leaving the things
       that are behind," is now the trumpet-sound by which he
       rallies his friends to a new confidence, and stimulates them
       to fresh efforts. It is obvious that Webster, when
       contending with all his force for or against some particular
       measure, has not been contemplating the probability of being
       compelled to oppose or defend a different policy, and, so,
       choosing his words warily, in reference to future
       possibilities of a personal kind: yet when the time has come
       that he has been obliged to fight with his face in another
       direction, it has always been found that no one principle
       had been asserted, no one sentiment displayed, incompatible
       with his new positions. This union of consistency with
       practicability has arisen naturally from the extent and
       comprehensiveness of his views, from the breadth and
       generality with which the analytical power of his
       understanding has always led him to state his principles and
       define his position. From the particular scheme or special
       maxim which his party was insisting upon, his mind rose to a
       higher and more general formula of truth.</p>

    <p>Owing to the same superior penetration and reach of thought,
    the gloom of successive repulses has never been able to
    paralyze the power which it has saddened. The constitution has
    been so often invaded and trampled upon, that to a common eye
    it might well seem to have lost all the resentments of
    vitality. But Webster has distinguished between the
    constitution and its administration. He has seen that the
    constitution, though in bondage, is not killed; that the
    channels of its life-giving wisdom are stuffed up with rubbish,
    but not obliterated. He has been determined that if the rulers
    of the country will deny the truth, they shall not debauch it;
    if they depart from the constitution, they shall not deprave
    it. He has been resolved, that when this tyranny of corruption
    shall be overpast, and the constitution draws again its own
    free breath of virtue, truth and wisdom, it shall be found
    perfect of limb and feature, prepared to rise like a giant
    refreshed by sleep.</p>

    <p>Mr. Griswold, we suppose, is quite right in suggesting that
    the only name in modern times to which reference can with any
    fitness be made for purposes of analogy or comparison with
    Webster is that of Burke. In many respects there is a
    correspondence between their characters; in some others they
    differ widely. As a prophet of the truth of political morals,
    as a revealer of those essential elements in the constitution
    of life, upon which, or of which, society is constructed and
    government evolved, Burke had no peer. In that department he
    rises into the distance and grandeur of inspiration; <i>nil
    mortote sonans</i>. Nor do we doubt that the Providence of God
    had raised him up for the purposes of public safety and
    guidance, any more than we doubt the mission of Jeremiah or
    Elisha, or any other of the school of the Lord's prophets. But
    leaving Burke unapproached in this region of the nature and
    philosophy of government, and looking at him, in his general
    career, as a man of intellect and action, we might indicate an
    analogy of this kind, that the character, temper and reason of
    Burke seem to be almost an image of the English constitution,
    and Webster's of the American. To get the key to Burke's
    somewhat irregular and startling career, it is necessary, to
    study the idea of the old whig constitution of the English
    monarchy: viewing his course from that point of view, we
    comprehend his almost countenancing and encouraging rebellion
    in the case of the American colonies; his intense hostility to
    Warren Hastings' imperial system; his unchastised earnestness
    in opposition to French maxims in the decline of his life. The
    constitution of the United States, that most wonderful of the
    emanations of providential wisdom, seems to be not only the
    home of Webster's affections and seat of his proudest hopes,
    but the very type of his understanding and fountain of his
    intellectual strength:</p>

    <p>The genius of Burke, like the one, was inexhaustible in
    resources, so composite and so averse from theory as to appear
    incongruous, but justified in the result; not formal, not
    always entirely perspicuous. Webster's mind, like the other, is
    eminently logical, reduced into principles, orderly, distinct,
    reconciling abstraction with convenience, various in
    manifestation, yet pervaded by an unity of character.</p>

    <p>Mr. Webster has not merely illustrated a great range of
    mental powers and accomplishments, but has filled, in the eye
    of the nation, on a great scale, and to the farthest reach of
    their exigency, a diversity of intellectual characters; while
    the manner in which Burke's wisdom displayed itself was usually
    the same. We cannot suppose that Burke could have been a great
    lawyer. Webster possesses a consummate legal judgment and
    prodigious powers of legal logic, and is felt to be the highest
    authority on a great question of law in this country. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page299"
       id="page299"></a>[pg 299]</span> demonstrative faculty; the
       capacity to analyze and open any proposition so as to
       identify its separate elements with the very consciousness
       of the reader's or hearer's mind; this, which is the
       lawyer's peculiar power, had not been particularly developed
       in Burke, but exists in Webster in greater expansion and
       force than in any one since Doctor Johnson, who, it always
       appeared to us, had he been educated for the bar, would have
       made the greatest lawyer that ever led the decisions of
       Westminster-Hall. We should hardly be justified in saying
       that Burke would have made a great First Lord of the
       Treasury. Mr. Webster, as Secretary of State, proved himself
       to be a practical statesman of the highest; finest,
       promptest sagacity and foresight that this or any nation
       ever witnessed. Who now doubts the surpassing wisdom, who
       now but reverences the exalted patriotism, of the advice and
       the example which he gave, but gave in vain, to the Whig
       party at the beginning of Mr. Tyler's administration? His
       official correspondence would be lowered by a comparison
       with any state papers since the secretaryship of John
       Marshall. Does the public generally know what has become of
       that portentous difficulty about the Right of Search, upon
       which England and America, five years ago, were on the point
       of being "<i>lento collisæ duello</i>." Mr. Webster settled
       it by mere force of mind: he dissipated the Question, <i>by
       seeing through it</i>, and by compelling others to see a
       fallacy in its terms which before had imposed upon the
       understanding of two nations. In the essential and universal
       philosophy of politics, Webster is second only to Burke.
       After Burke, there is no statesman whose writings might be
       read with greater advantage by foreign nations, or would
       have been studied with so much respect by antiquity, as
       Webster's.</p>

    <p>In a merely literary point of view, this perhaps may be said
    of Mr. Webster, that he is the only powerful and fervid orator,
    since the glorious days of Greece, whose style is so
    disciplined that any of his great public harangues might be
    used as models of composition. His language is beautifully
    pure, and his combinations of it exhibit more knowledge of the
    genius, spirit, and classic vigor of the English tongue, than
    it has entered the mind of any professor of rhetoric to
    apprehend. As the most impetuous sweeps of passion in him are
    pervaded and informed and guided by intellect, so the most
    earnest struggles of intellect seem to be calmed and made
    gentle in their vehemence, by a more essential rationality of
    taste. That imperious mind, which seems fit to defy the
    universe, is ever subordinate, by a kind of fascination, to the
    perfect law of grace. In the highest of his intellectual
    flights&mdash;and who can follow the winged rush of that eagle
    mind?&mdash;in the widest of his mental ranges-and who shall
    measure their extent?&mdash;he is ever moving within the
    severest line of beauty. No one would think of saying that Mr.
    Webster's speeches are thrown off with ease, and cost him but
    little effort; they are clearly the result of the intensest
    stress of mental energy; yet the manner is never discomposed;
    the decency and propriety of the display never interfered with;
    he is always greater than his genius; you see "the depth out
    not the tumult" of the mind. Whether, with extended arm, he
    strangles the "reluctantes dracones" of democracy, or with
    every faculty called home, concentrates the light and heat of
    his being in developing into principles those great sentiments
    and great instincts which are his inspiration; in all, the
    orator stands forth with the majesty and chastened grace of
    Pericles himself. In the fiercest of encounters with the
    deadliest of foes, the mind, which is enraged, is never
    perturbed; the style, which leaps like the fire of heaven, is
    never disordered. As in Guido's picture of St. Michael piercing
    the dragon, while the gnarled muscles of the arms and hands
    attest the utmost strain of the strength, the countenance
    remains placid, serene, and undisturbed. In this great quality
    of mental dignity, Mr. Webster's speeches have become more and
    more eminent. The glow and luster which set his earlier
    speeches a-blaze with splendor, is in his later discourses
    rarely let forth; but they have gained more, in the increase of
    dignity, than they have parted with in the diminution of
    brilliancy. We regard his speech before the shop-keepers,
    calling themselves merchants, of Philadelphia, as one of the
    most weighty and admirable of the intellectual efforts of his
    life. The range of profound and piercing wisdom; the exquisite
    and faultless taste; but above all, the august and indefectible
    dignity, that are illustrated from the beginning to the end of
    that great display of matured and finished strength, leave us
    in mingled wonder and reverence. There is one sentence there
    which seems to us almost to reach the <i>intellectual</i>
    sublime; and while it stirs within us the depths of sympathy
    and admiration, we could heartily wish that the young men of
    America would inhale the almost supra-mortal spirit which it
    breathes: "I would not with any idolatrous admiration regard
    the Constitution of the United States, nor any other work of
    man; but this side of idolatry, I hold it in profound respect.
    I believe that no human working on such a subject, no human
    ability exerted for such an end, has ever produced so much
    happiness, or holds out now to so many millions of people the
    prospect, through such a succession of ages and ages, of so
    much happiness, as the Constitution of the United States. We
    who are here for one generation, for a single life, and yet in
    our several stations and relations in society intrusted in some
    degree with its protection and support, what duty does it
    devolve, what duty does it <i>not</i> devolve, upon us!" In the
    name of distant ages, and a remote posterity, we hail the
    author of this and similar orations, as Webster the
    <i>Olympian</i>.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page300"
       id="page300"></a>[pg 300]</span>

    <p>But we leave a subject which we have incidentally touched,
    sincerely disclaiming any attempt to estimate the character or
    define the greatness of Webster. In reference to him we feel,
    as Cicero said to Cæsar, "<i>Nil vulgare te dignum videri
    possit.</i>"</p>

    <h2>THE NEW PROPHET IN THE EAST.<a id="footnotetag5"
       name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a></h2>

    <p>The vicissitudes of the war in the Caucasus of late have
    been surprising enough to awaken the interest of Western
    Europe, even amidst her own nearer anxieties. Last year it was
    said that the conquest of Achulgo, the stronghold of the
    redoubtable Schamyl, had effectually broken the power of that
    daring leader. In direct contradiction to such reports, later
    accounts from Daghestan tell of the reappearance of the notable
    partisan amidst the lines of the Russians, and of a defeat of
    the latter, the most severe, if the details of the event be
    true, that they have yet suffered in the Caucasus. In any case,
    these exciting changes of fortune would be in favor of a book
    professing to describe this interesting region, and to add to
    our knowledge of its brave inhabitants. The main interest of
    Herr Bodenstedt's work will now be enhanced by its undertaking
    to give a more precise account than had previously appeared of
    the priest-warrior of Daghestan. and of the new sect as the
    prophet of which he succeeded in arraying the independent
    mountain clans against their common enemy with a kind of
    combination unknown in earlier periods of the struggle.</p>

    <p>The author has evidently lived for some time in the region
    which he describes, or in the bordering districts along the
    Caspian, both in Georgia and in North Daghestan, His
    acquaintance with Asiatic and Russian languages and customs
    appears to have been gained both by study and from intercourse
    with the natives of the south-eastern frontier. He is not
    ignorant of Oriental writings that refer to his subject; and
    his Russian statistics prove an access to official authorities
    which are not to be found in print. These, however obtained,
    can scarcely have been imparted to him as one of those writers
    whom the Court of St. Petersburg hires to promote its views
    through the press of Western Europe. His sympathies are
    declared against Russian usurpation; and the tendency of his
    essay is to prove how little real progress it has yet made in
    subduing the Caucasus, the enormous waste of money and life
    with which its fluctuating successes have been bought, and the
    fallacy of expecting a better result hereafter.</p>

    <p>What it has cost in life on the Russian side to
    attack-hitherto with no lasting effect&mdash;the handful of
    Caucasian mountaineers, may be guessed from a single note,
    dated 1847: "The present Russian force in the
    Caucasus"&mdash;including of course, the armed Cossacks of the
    Kuban and Terek&mdash;"amounts to two hundred thousand." Taking
    into account the numbers yearly cut off by disease, more fatal
    even than the mountain war, every step of which must be won by
    the most reckless waste of life,&mdash;the "Russian Officer"
    may perhaps truly affirm that the <i>annual</i> expenditure of
    life by Russia, in her warfare with Schamyl, has for many years
    past exceeded the whole number of the population at any one
    time directly under the rule of that chieftain.</p>

    <p>We have said that the most instructive part of Herr
    Bodenstedt's essay is his sketch of that politico-religious
    scheme which made Schamyl formidable to the Russians. This
    system, it is to be observed, arose and has since been fully
    developed only in the Eastern Caucasus, where of late the main
    stress of the war has been. The western tribes (our
    "Circassians") who took the lead at an earlier stage of the
    contest, were not then, nor have they since been, inspired by
    the fanatic zeal which united the tribes of Daghestan. They
    fought from a mere love of independence, each little republic
    by itself; and their efforts, however heroic, being without
    concert, gradually declined before the vast force of the
    invader. In the region looking westward from the Georgian
    frontier on the Euxine, on the one side of the Caucasian range,
    and along the lower Kuban on the other, the Russian posts are
    now seldom threatened but by small predatory bands; the
    natives, retired to their mountain villages, have for some time
    made but few more formidable incursions. The war is transferred
    to the region spreading eastward from the Elbrus to the
    Caspian; where the strife for free existence is animated not
    less by the hatred of Russian slavery than by a fresh outbreak
    of Mohammedan zeal against infidel invasion,&mdash;a revival,
    in fact, of that war-like fanaticism which made the Moslem name
    terrible from the eighth to the sixteenth century.</p>

    <p>It dates from the years 1823-4; at which period a "new
    doctrine" began to be preached, secretly at first, to the
    select Uléma, afterward to greater numbers, in word and
    writing, by one Mullah Mohammed, a famous teacher and a judge
    (or <i>kadi</i>) of Jarach, in the Kurin district of Daghestan.
    He professed to have learnt it from Hadis-Ismail, an Alim of
    Kurdomir, highly famed for wisdom and sanctity. It laid bare
    the degradation into which his countrymen had sunk by
    irreligion and by the jealousy of sect; their danger, in
    consequence, from enemies of the true faith; and urged the
    necessity of reform in creed and practice, in order to regain
    the invincible character promised by the Prophet to believers.
    The theoretical part of the reformed doctrine seems to be a
    kind of Sufism,&mdash;the general character of which mode of
    Islam, long prevalent in the adjacent kingdom of Persia, has
    been described <span class="pagenum"><a name="page301"
       id="page301"></a>[pg 301]</span> by our own orientalists.
       Disputed questions as to its origin, whether in Brahmin
       philosophy or in the reveries of Moslem mystics, cannot be
       discussed here; it must suffice to indicate those points
       which appear to connect it with the hieratic policy that has
       given a new aspect to the war in the Caucasus.</p>

    <p>Proceeding nominally on the basis of the Koran, it
    inculcates or expounds a kind of spiritual transcendentalism;
    in which the adept is raised above the necessity of formal
    laws, which are only requisite for those who are not capable of
    rising to a full intelligence of the supreme power. To gain
    this height, by devout contemplation, must be the personal work
    and endeavor of each individual. The revelation of divine
    truth, once attained, supersedes specific moral injunctions;
    ceremonies and systems, even, of religion, become indifferent
    to the mind illuminated by the sacred idea. A higher degree is
    the perfect conception or ecstatic vision of the
    Deity;&mdash;the highest-reserved only for the prophetic
    few&mdash;a real immediate union with his essence. Here, it
    will be seen, are four steps or stages, each of which has its
    sacred manual or appropriate system of teaching. In the
    hieratic system, of which Schamyl is the head, the divisions
    seem to correspond pretty nearly with this arrangement, as
    follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>The <i>first</i> includes the mass of the armed people;
    whose zeal it promotes by strict religious and moral
    injunctions enjoining purity of life, exact regard to the
    ritual of the Koran, teaching pilgrimages, fasting, ablutions;
    the duty of implacable war against the Infidel, the sin of
    enduring his tyranny.</p>

    <p>The <i>second</i> is composed of those, who, in virtue of
    striving upward to a higher Divine intelligence, are elevated
    above ceremonial religion. Of these the <i>Murids</i>
    (<i>seekers</i> or <i>strugglers</i>,) are formed: a body of
    religious warriors attached to the Imam, whose courage in
    battle, raised to a kind of frenzy, despises numbers and laughs
    at death. To accept quarter, or to fly from the Infidel, is
    forbidden to this class.</p>

    <p>The <i>third</i> includes the more perfect acolytes, who are
    presumed to have risen to the ecstatic view of the Deity. These
    are the elect, whom the Imam makes <i>Naibs</i> or
    vice-regents,&mdash;invested with nearly absolute power in his
    absence.</p>

    <p>The <i>fourth</i>, or highest, implying entire union with
    the Divine essence, is held by Schamyl alone. In virtue of this
    elevation and spiritual endowment, the Imam, as an immediate
    organ of the Supreme Will, is himself the source of all law to
    his followers, unerring, impeccable; to question or disobey his
    behests is a sin against religion, as well as a political
    crime. It may be seen what advantage this system must have
    given to Schamyl in his conflict with the Russians. The
    doctrine of the indifference of sects and forms enabled him to
    unite the divided followers of Omar and of Ali, in a region
    where both abound, and where the schism had formerly been one
    of the most effectual instruments of the enemy. The belief in a
    Divine mission and spiritual powers sustains his adherents in
    all reverses; while it invites to defection from the Russian
    side those of the Mohammedan tribes who have submitted to the
    invader. Among these, however, Schamyl, like his predecessors
    in the same priestly office, by no means confides the progress
    of his sect to spiritual influences only. The work of
    conversion, where exhortation fails, is carried on
    remorselessly by fire and sword; and the Imam is as terrible to
    those of his countrymen whom fear or interest retains in
    alliance with Russia, as to the soldiers of the Czar. With a
    character in which extreme daring is allied with coolness,
    cunning, and military genius, with a good fortune which has
    hitherto preserved his life in many circumstances where escape
    seemed impossible,&mdash;it may be seen that the belief in his
    supernatural gifts and privileges, once created, must always
    tend to increase in intensity and effect among the imaginative
    and credulous Mohammedans of the Caucasus; and that this apt
    combination of the warrior with the politician and prophet
    accounts for his success in combining against the Russians a
    force of the once discordant tribes of Daghestan, possessing
    more of the character of a national resistance than had been
    ever known before in the Caucasus,&mdash;and compelling the
    invaders to purchase every one of their few, trifling, and
    dubious advances by the terrible sacrifice of life already
    noticed.</p>

    <p>In this formidable movement the highlander's natural freedom
    is fanned into a blaze by a religious zeal like that which once
    led the armies of Islam over one half of Asia and Europe.
    Although it reached its highest energy and a more consummate
    development under Schamyl, it was begun by his predecessors. Of
    the Mullah Mohammed, who first preached the duty of casting off
    the yoke of the Giaour, and the necessity of a religious reform
    and union of rival sects, as a means to that end, we have
    already spoken. This founder of the new system, an aged man,
    untrained in arms, never himself drew the sword in the cause;
    but was active in diffusing its principles and preparing a
    warlike rising by exhortations and letters circulated through
    all Daghestan. Suspected of these designs, he was seized, in
    1826, by the orders of Jermoloff; and although be
    escaped,&mdash;by the connivance, it is said, of the native
    prince employed to capture him,&mdash;he afterward lived, in a
    kind of concealment, for some years. The post of Imam was
    thereupon assumed by a priest who was able to fight for the new
    doctrine as well as to preach it. The first armed outbreak took
    place under Kasi-Mullah, about the year 1829; from which time,
    until his death in a battle at Himry, in 1831, he waged a
    terrible, and, although often defeated, a virtually
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page302"
       id="page302"></a>[pg 302]</span> successful warfare, against
       the Russians, while he prosecuted the work of conversion
       among the tribes of Islam who delayed to acknowledge his
       mission, and to join in his enmity to the Russians, by the
       extremities of bloodshed and rapine. His death, after an
       heroic resistance, was hailed as a triumph by the Russians.
       They counted on the extinction of the new sect in the defeat
       of its leader, whose dead body they carried about the
       country to prove the imposture of his pretensions. This
       piece of barbarism produced an effect the reverse of what
       they expected. The venerable face of the Imam, the attitude
       in which he had expired, with one hand pointed as if to
       heaven, was more impressive to those who crowded round the
       body than his fearless enthusiasm had been,&mdash;and
       thousands who till then had held aloof, now joined his
       followers in venerating him as a prophet. Of this first
       warrior-priest of Daghestan, Schamyl was the favorite
       disciple and the most trusted soldier. Kasi-Mullah was not
       killed until Schamyl had already fallen as it seemed, under
       several deadly wounds:&mdash;his reappearance after this
       bloody scene was but the first of many similar escapes, the
       report of which sounds like a fable. He did not, however, at
       once succeed to the dignity of Imam: the office was usurped
       for more than a year by Hamsad Beg (Bey), whose rapacious
       and savage treatment of some of the princely families of
       Daghestan nearly caused a fatal reaction against the new
       sect, and the destruction of its main support, the Murids.
       Hamsad Beg performed no action of consequence against the
       Russians; but expended his rage upon the natives allied with
       them, or reluctant to obey his mandates. He was assassinated
       in 1834, by some kinsmen of a princely house whose
       territories he had usurped after a massacre of its princes.
       In the affray which took place on this occasion, there
       perished with him many of the fanatic Murids, who had become
       odious as instruments of the cruelties of their Imam. On his
       death, Schamyl was raised to the dignity,&mdash;but it was
       some time before the mischief done by his predecessor was so
       far repaired as to allow him to act with energy as the
       prophet of the new doctrine. One of the ill effects of
       Hamsad Beg's iniquities had been the defection to the
       Russians of n notable partisan&mdash;Hadjii Murad&mdash;for
       many years a fatal thorn in the side of the independent
       party.<a id="footnotetag6"
       name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>
       This and other difficulties, among which was the
       unpopularity of the Murids under Hamsad Beg, were removed by
       new alliances and precautions, while all that eloquence and
       skill could perform was applied to restore the credit of the
       religious system, before Schamyl could hazard a direct
       attack of the Russian enemy, who meanwhile had taken
       advantage of the delay and disunion to gain ground in many
       parts of Daghestan. From the year 1839, however, the tide
       rapidly turned; and the result, from that date until the
       period at which the account closes (1845)&mdash;when
       Woronzow was appointed to command in the Caucasus, with
       nearly unlimited powers,&mdash;has been, that the Russians,
       in spite of tremendous sacrifices, were constantly losing
       ground and influence, while Schamyl gained both in equal
       proportion. The details of the campaigns during this
       interval are highly interesting; and we regret that
       conditions of space forbid us to translate some of the
       exciting episodes recorded by Herr Bodenstedt. We may,
       however, extract the following account of the Caucasian
       hero,&mdash;whose portrait, we believe, has never before
       been so fully exhibited to European readers;&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Schamyl is of middle stature; he has light hair, gray eyes,
    shaded by bushy and well-arched eyebrows,&mdash;a nose finely
    moulded, and a small mouth. His features are distinguished from
    those of his race by a peculiar fairness of complexion and
    delicacy of skin: the elegant form of his hands and feet is not
    less remarkable. The apparent stiffness of his arms, when he
    walks, is a sign of his stern and impenetrable character. His
    address is thoroughly noble and dignified. Of himself he is
    completely master; and he exerts a tacit supremacy over all who
    approach him. An immovable stony calmness, which never forsakes
    him, even in moments of the utmost danger, broods over his
    countenance. He passes a sentence of death with the same
    composure with which he distributes "the sabre of honor" to his
    bravest Murids, after a bloody encounter. With traitors or
    criminals whom he has resolved to destroy, he will converse
    without betraying the least sign of anger or vengeance. He
    regards himself as a mere instrument in the hands of a higher
    Being; and holds, according to the Sufi doctrine, that all his
    thoughts and determinations are immediate inspirations from
    God. The flow of his speech is as animating and irresistible as
    his outward appearance is awful and commanding. "He shoots
    flames from his eyes, and scatters flowers from his
    lips,"&mdash;said Bersek Bey, who sheltered him for some days
    after the fall of Achulgo,&mdash;when Schamyl dwelt for some
    time among the princes of the Djighetes and Ubiches, for the
    purpose of inciting the tribes on the Black Sea to rise against
    the Russians. Schamyl is now (<i>circa</i> 1847?) fifty years
    old, but still full of vigor and strength: it is however said,
    that he has for some years past suffered from an obstinate
    disease of the eyes, which is constantly growing worse. He
    fills the intervals of leisure which his public charges allow
    him, in reading the Koran, fasting, and prayer. Of late years
    he has but seldom, and then only on critical occasions, taken a
    personal share in warlike encounters. In spite of his almost
    supernatural activity, Schamyl is excessively
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page303"
       id="page303"></a>[pg 303]</span> severe and temperate in his
       habits. A few hours of sleep are enough for him: at times he
       will watch for the whole night, without Showing the least
       trace of fatigue on the following day. He eats little, and
       water is his only beverage. According to Mohammedan custom,
       he keeps several wives&mdash;[this contradicts Wagner, who
       affirms that Schamyl always confined himself to one]; in
       1844 he had <i>three</i>, of which his favorite, <i>Dur
       Heremen</i>, (Pearl of the Harem) as she was called, was an
       Armenian, of exquisite beauty."</p>

    <p>Will Russian arms prevail in the end? The following is Herr
    Bodenstedt's answer; after noticing the arrival of Woronzow,
    and the expectations raised by his talents, by the immense
    resources at his command, as well as by such events as the
    storm of Schamyl's stronghold of Cargo:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"He who believes that the issue of this contest hangs on the
    destruction of stone fortresses, on the devastation of tracts
    of forest, has not yet conceived the essential nature of the
    war in the Caucasus. This is not merely a war of men against
    men&mdash;it is a strife between the mountain and the steppe.
    The population of the Caucasus may be changed; the air of
    liberty wafted from its heights will ever remain the same.
    Invigorated by this atmosphere, even Russian hirelings would
    grow into men eager for freedom: and among their descendants a
    new race of heroes would arise, to point their weapons against
    that servile constitution, to extend which their fathers had
    once fought, as blind, unquestioning slaves."</p>

    <p>To this answer of Herr Bodenstedt's we will add nothing of
    our own. We are weary with waiting for the events of history
    such as we would have them.</p>

    <h2>COOLING A BURNING SPIRIT.</h2>

    <p>An incident which occurred soon after the accession of the
    present Sultan, shows that, in some respects, at least, he is
    not indisposed to follow up the strong traditions of his race.
    At the beginning of his reign, the Ulema was resolved, if
    possible, to prevent the new Sultan from carrying on those
    reforms which had ever been so distasteful to the Turks,
    grating at once against their religious associations and their
    pride of race, and which recent events had certainly proved not
    to be productive of those good results anticipated by Sultan
    Mamoud. To attain this object, the Muftis adopted the expedient
    of working on the religious fears of the youthful prince. One
    day as he was praying, according to his custom, at his father's
    tomb, he heard a voice from beneath reiterating, in a stifled
    tone, the words, "I burn." The next time that he prayed there
    the same words assailed his ears. "I burn" was repeated again
    and again, and no word beside. He applied to the chief of the
    Imams to know what this prodigy might mean; and was informed in
    reply, that his father, though a great man, had also been,
    unfortunately, a great reformer, and that as such it was too
    much to be feared that he had a terrible penance to undergo in
    the other world. The Sultan sent for his brother-in-law to pray
    at the same place, and afterward several others of his
    household; and on each occasion the same portentous words were
    heard. One day he announced his intention of going in state to
    his father's tomb, and was attended thither by a splendid
    retinue, including the chief doctors of the Mahometan law.
    Again, during his devotions, were heard the words, "I burn,"
    and all except the Sultan trembled. Rising from his
    prayer-carpet, he called in his guards, and commanded them to
    dig up the pavement and remove the tomb. It was in vain that
    the Muftis interposed, reprobating so great a profanation, and
    uttering warnings as to its consequences. The Sultan persisted,
    the foundations of the tomb were laid bare, and in a cavity
    skillfully left among them was found&mdash;not a burning
    Sultan, but a Dervise. The young monarch regarded him for a
    time fixedly and in silence, and then said, without any further
    remark or the slightest expression of anger, "You
    burn?&mdash;We must cool you in the Bosphorus." In a few
    minutes more the dervise was in a bag, and the bag immediately
    after was in the Bosphorus.&mdash;<i>De Vere's

    <h2>KILLING A GIRAFFE.</h2>

    <p>At every stride I gained upon the giraffes, and, after a
    short burst at a swingeing gallop, I was in the middle of them,
    and turned the finest cow out of the herd. On finding herself
    driven from her comrades and hotly pursued, she increased her
    pace, and cantered along with tremendous strides, clearing an
    amazing extent of ground at every bound; while her neck and
    breast, coming in contact with the dead old branches of the
    trees, were continually strewing them in my path. In a few
    minutes I was riding within five yards of her stern, and,
    firing at a gallop, I sent a bullet into her back. Increasing
    my pace, I next rode alongside, and, placing the muzzle of my
    rifle within a few feet of her, I fired my second shot behind
    the shoulder; the ball, however, seemed to have little effect.
    I then placed myself directly in front, when she came to a
    walk. Dismounting, I hastily loaded both barrels, putting in
    double charges of powder. Before this was accomplished, she was
    off at a canter. In a short time I brought her to a stand in
    the dry bed of a watercourse, where I fired at fifteen yards,
    aiming where I thought the heart lay, upon which she again made
    off. Having loaded, I followed, and had very nearly lost her;
    she had turned abruptly to the left, and was far out of sight
    among the trees. Once more I brought her to a stand, and
    dismounted from my horse. There we stood together alone in the
    wild wood. I gazed in wonder at her extreme beauty, while her
    soft dark eye, with its silky fringe, looked down imploringly
    at me, and I really felt a pang of sorrow in this moment of
    triumph for the blood I was shedding. Pointing my rifle toward
    the skies, I sent a bullet through her neck. On receiving it
    she reared high on her hind legs and fell back with a heavy
    crash, making the earth shake around her. A thick stream of
    dark blood spouted out from the wound, her colossal limbs
    quivered for a moment, and she expired.&mdash;<i>Cummings'

    <h2>THE VETERAN KOLOMBESKI.</h2>

    <p>Several journals have spoken of the entry into the Hotel des
    Invalides of a soldier, stated to be 126 years of age. This is
    not quite correct. The following are some precise details
    respecting this extraordinary man, who arrived at the Hotel on
    the 21st inst.:&mdash;Jean Kolombeski, born at Astrona
    (Poland), on the 1st of March, 1730, entered the service of
    France, as a volunteer in the Bourbon regiment of infantry, in
    1774, at the age of forty-four. He was made corporal in 1790,
    at the age of sixty. He made all the campaigns of the
    Revolution and of the Empire, in different regiments of
    infantry, and was incorporated, in 1808, in the 3d regiment of
    the Vistula. He was wounded in 1814, and entered the hospital
    at Poitiers, which he soon afterward left to be placed <i>en
    subsistence</i> in the 2d regiment of light infantry. On the
    11th of October of the same year he was admitted into the 1st
    company of <i>sous-officiers sedentaires</i>, and, in 1846,
    into the 5th company of Veteran Sub-Officers. The last three of
    these companies having just been suppressed by the Minister of
    War, Kolombeski was placed <i>en subsistence</i> in the 61st
    regiment of the line, received a retiring pension by decree of
    May 17, 1850, and the Minister authorized his admission into
    the Invalides. Kolombeski is, therefore, more than 120 years of
    age; he reckons seventy-five and a half years of service, and
    twenty-nine campaigns. He enjoys good health, is strong and
    well made, and does not appear to be more than seventy or
    eighty. He performed every duty with big comrades of the 5th
    company of Veterans, When King Louis Philippe visited Dreus,
    Kolombeski was presented to him, who, taking the decoration
    from his breast, presented it to the veteran soldier. This is
    the most astonishing instance of longevity that has, perhaps,
    been ever known in the army. The Marshal Governor of the
    Invalides ordered that Kolombeski should be brought to him on
    his arrival; but, as the old soldier was fatigued, he was taken
    to the infirmary, and the Governor, informed of it, went to his
    bedside with General Petit, the commandant of the hotel, and
    addressed the veteran in the kindest manner. The Governor has
    issued an order that, for the future, all centenarian soldiers
    admitted into the hospital shall mess with the officers, in
    order to show his respect for their age, and for the long
    services they have rendered to the state.&mdash;<i>Galignani's
    Messenger</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>ANECDOTE OF LORD BROUGHAM.</h2>

    <p>The "Life of the Rev. Dr. Hugh Heugh" has a description of
    an interview which a deputation of Scotch dissenters had some
    years ago with Lord Brougham. The <i>Scotsman</i> adds, from
    its private knowledge, some odd incidents of the affair.</p>

    <p>His lordship, on coming out of the court to meet the
    deputation, immediately on being informed of their object,
    burst out in a volley of exclamations to the effect that, but
    for dissent, there would be "No vital religion&mdash;no vital
    religion, gentlemen, no vital religion." While pouring forth
    this in a most solemn tone, he was all the while shaking
    violently the locked doors of a lobby full of committee rooms,
    into one of which he wished to find entrance, and calling for
    an absent official not only in passionate tones, but in
    phraseology which the reverend deputation, at first unwilling
    to trust their own ears, were at last forced to believe was
    nothing better than profane swearing. At last, he suddenly drew
    himself up to the wall opposite a locked door, and with a
    tremendous kick, smashed the lock, and entered (exclaiming,
    first in a vehement and then in a solemn tone, but without
    pause) "&mdash;that fellow! where the &mdash;&mdash; does he
    always go to! No vital religion, gentlemen, no vital
    religion&mdash;no, no, no."</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
